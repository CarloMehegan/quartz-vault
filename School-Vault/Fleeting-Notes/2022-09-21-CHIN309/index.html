&ldquo;took omens&rdquo; - strong culture of divination
author is establishing connection to the gods, divine birth
&ldquo;basically saying im important by virtue of my birth&rdquo;
author? narrator? point of view character whoever this is</p><p>relationship between inner and outer beauty
fear of aging
fear of time passing by
focus on flora &ldquo;autumn orchids, selinea, shady angelica&rdquo;
speaker is presenting themself as important person of society, becomes clearer as we go that they are presenting themself as a shaman</p><p>seen often in this literature
spring = time of birth
autumn = time of growing older</p><p>&ldquo;feared that my Fairest&rsquo;s beauty would fade too&rdquo;
who is this? the narrator, the king, love interest?</p><p>idea of things being in their proper place
&ldquo;otherwise society cant function&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;three kings of old&rdquo;
mention of the legendary three kings</p><p>&ldquo;pepper and cinnamon&rdquo;
fragrant plants
fragrant plants lose their fragrance over time
political interpretation about dynasties rising and falling
the first kings of the dynasties are righteous and good, the last kings are bad and crooked and have lost the mandate of heaven</p><p>in shamanistic practice, as they run out of fragrance, they lose power to do shaman stuff
could represent Qu Yuan&rsquo;s ability to serve his king as a minister, losing the power to do so</p><p>&ldquo;the Fragrant One&rdquo;
&ldquo;who these people are is subject to literally thousands of years of arguments&rdquo;
according to David Hawkes:
the chinese word used here is the name of a flower
interpreted to mean the poets king
may be a term of the endearment</p><p>&ldquo;loyalty brings disaster&rdquo; even though it is important to be loyal</p><p>line 29
&ldquo;thought famine should pinch me it is small matter
but i grieve that all my blossoms should waste in rank weeds&rdquo;</p><p>line 33
&ldquo;for old age comes creeping and soon will be upon me
and i fear i shall not leave behind an enduring name&rdquo;</p><p>fears not being remembered - contrasts from themes weve seen in other readings
in <a href=/quartz-vault/School-Vault/Fleeting-Notes/2022-09-19-CHIN309#zhuangzi-basic-writings rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz-vault/School-Vault/Fleeting-Notes/2022-09-19-CHIN309>Zhuangzi</a> and in <a href=/quartz-vault/School-Vault/Fleeting-Notes/2022-09-14-CHIN309#the-analects rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz-vault/School-Vault/Fleeting-Notes/2022-09-14-CHIN309>Confucianism</a>, big criticisms of chasing fame</p><p>line 34
&ldquo;in the morning i drank the dew that fell from the magnolia
at evening ate the petals that dropped from chrysanthemums&rdquo;
not very filling food</p><p>line 35-37
speaker is adorning themselves with all of these plants
we havent seen talk of fashion in other works</p><p>line 38-39
&ldquo;I take my fashion from the food men of old
a garb unlike that which the rude world cares for
though it may not accord with present day manners
i will follow the pattern that P&rsquo;eng Hsien has left&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;reminds me of this simpsons clip&rdquo;
grandpa simpson &ldquo;i had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the name&rdquo;
Qu Yuan talking about the styles at the time</p><p>line 45
seems like it switches between a woman talking and a man talking
but it should be just one person speaking
trans icon perhaps?
&ldquo;all your ladies were jealous of my delicate beauty&rdquo;
interpreted as a metaphor for the king&rsquo;s other ministers
Qu Yuan was using both men and women&rsquo;s voices to represent himself
ok genderfluid icon</p><p>&ldquo;you can see why these political interpretation is very tempting&rdquo;
what other interpretations are there?</p><p>question from someone - &ldquo;relationship to hundred flowers campaign&rdquo;</p><p>line 48-50
god complex?
speaker sees themself as better than those around them</p><p>at a certain point the speaker says &ldquo;im out of here&rdquo; to chase off after a god/goddess</p><p>line 58. another line about fashion</p><p>line 65?
&ldquo;I could not change this even if my body were dismembered&rdquo;
sheesh</p><p>line 68
&ldquo;why be so lofty with you passion for prity?
why must you alone have such delicate adornment?&rdquo;
talking about fashion again
&ldquo;thorns, king-grass, curly-ear hold the place of power
but you must needs stand apart and not speak them fair&rdquo;</p><p>question from someone - &ldquo;is this walking the line of being seditious?&rdquo;
yes (i dont really get why these lines specifically are) but the king was dead already when this was written
scholars later said &ldquo;look at how Qu Yuan feels free to speak in criticism of his king we should all do this even if it risks death&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;you cannot go from door to door convincing everybody
no one can say &lsquo;see, look into my mind!&rsquo;&rdquo;
confucius was doing this, traveling to states teaching</p><p>line 97-
starts getting mythical and weird
the very gods themselves being his companions
&ldquo;still not able to influence the world in the way he wants to&rdquo;</p><p>line 113-
tries to woo a goddess is unsuccessful</p><p>skipping ahead</p><p>lots of flower talk frrr</p><p>things dont go well for him</p><p>line 186 - 187: the end
&ldquo;enough! there are no true men in the state: no one to understand me.
why should i cleave to the city of my birth?
since none is worthy to work with in making good government,
i will go and join P&rsquo;eng Hsien in the place where he abides.&rdquo;</p><p>peng hsien and qu yuan both drowned themselves</p><a href=#remarks-on-the-reading><h5 id=remarks-on-the-reading><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>remarks on the reading</h5></a><p>other ppls remarks:
beauty is mentioned a lot, very different from previous readings
hypocritical; talks about being humble, has a god complex
feels very &ldquo;I was born in the wrong generation&rdquo;
didnt expect for later figures to revere this character - how did it get to that point?
very well received starting like 130 years after being written
themes of rejection and loneliness, coping &ldquo;well the gods like me&rdquo;
&ldquo;narrator is definitely depressed&rdquo;
does Qu Yuan self insert himself as the narrator?
people have read this typically as autobiographical
very plausible assumption; what we know about the historical figure lines up well with what we see in the poem</p><p>my remarks:
very queer interpretation possible
was there gay representation back then i mean probably not but how was that received</p><p>next time
Sima Qian&rsquo;s revords of the grand historian - Annals of Emperor Gaozu
&ldquo;can be difficult to follow - uses multiple names/titles for one person&rdquo;</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://carlomehegan.github.io/quartz-vault/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Jacky Zhao using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, Â© 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://carlomehegan.github.io/quartz-vault/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
