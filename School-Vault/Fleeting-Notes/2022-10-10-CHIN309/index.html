not suited for court job, eccentric
caught up in An Lushan rebellion
stuff happened
eventually pardoned for stuff because of his skill in poetry
becomes known during his lifetime as a famous poet
his poetry is full of a wide variety of themes
not particularly autobiographical
a lot of his poems are easier to understand than other poets weve seen</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p>Still Night Thoughts

took joy in celebration
common theme in his works is drinking</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p>Drinking Alone in the Moonlight
Beneath the blossoms with a pot of wine,<br>No friends at hand, so I poured alone;<br>I raised my cup to invite the moon,<br>Turned to my shadow, and we became three.<br>Now the moon had never learned about drinking,<br>And my shadow had merely followed my form,<br>But I quickly made friends with the moon and my shadow;<br>To find pleasure in life, make the most of the spring.<br>Whenever I sang, the moon swayed with me;<br>Whenever I danced, my shadow went wild.<br>Drinking, we shared our enjoyment together;<br>Drunk, then each went off on his own.<br>But forever agreed on dispassionate revels,
We promised to meet in the far Milky Way.</p></blockquote><p>references to the moon again
finding pleasure in life
personification of nature
attempts at finding joy in solitude

I love the Master, Meng Hao-jan,
A free spirit known the whole world through.
In the flush of youth he spurned the cap and carriage,
And rests now, white-haired with age, among clouds and pines.</p></blockquote><p>showing respect to a poet he looked up to, Meng Hao-jan</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p>To Send to Tu Fu as a Joke
I ran into Tu Fu by a Rice Grain Mountain,
In a bamboo hat with the sun at high noon.
Hasn&rsquo;t he gotten awfully thin since our parting?
It must be the struggle of writing his poems.</p></blockquote><p>poking fun at one of his contemporaries, Tu Fu
lighthearted
knows that Tu Fu looks up to him</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p>Poems in an Old Style
&mldr;</p></blockquote><p>&mldr;</p><p>people writing poetry are usually from aristocratic families
for people like Li Bai, sponsorship by the emperor
many people were both officials and poets</p><a href=#du-fu-712-770><h5 id=du-fu-712-770><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Du Fu 712-770</h5></a><p>the guy from two poems ago
~10 years younger than Li Bai

a lot of his poetry focuses on these events of his life</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p>Spring View
The nation is ruined, but mountains and rivers remain.<br>This spring the city is deep in weeds and brush.<br>Touched by the times even flowers weep tears,<br>Fearing leaving the birds tangled hearts.<br>Watch-tower fires have been burning for three months
Beacon fires three months in succession,<br>a letter from home worth ten thousand in gold.<br>White hairs, fewer for the scratching,<br>soon too few to hold a hairpin up.</p></blockquote><p>one of his most famous poems
written while in captivation with his family
poem about wartime
regulated verse, 4 couplets of 5 characters
pessimistic, heavier topics
An Lushan rebellion was around 755
using spring, flowers, birds, to express grief</p><a href=#du-fu-and-li-bai><h5 id=du-fu-and-li-bai><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Du Fu and Li Bai</h5></a><p>its giving sam and cat?</p><p>think about how Du Fu references Li Bai vs how Li Bai references Du Fu</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p>At the Sky&rsquo;s End, Thinking of Li Po
Cold winds rise from the edge of heaven
True Gentleman how fares your thought
wild geese what hour is your arrival
river and lake swell with autumn waters
literature is adverse to good fortune
marsh trolls relish the passerby
you ought to share a word with the slandered spirit
hurl a poem to him in the Mi-lo River</p></blockquote><p>Du Fu had respect for Li Bai
mention of Gentleman, like <a class="internal-link broken">Confucius</a>
mention of Mi-lo River, where <a href=/quartz-vault/School-Vault/Fleeting-Notes/2022-09-21-CHIN309#qu-yuan rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz-vault/School-Vault/Fleeting-Notes/2022-09-21-CHIN309>Qu Yuan</a> committed suicide</p><p>unlike Li Bai, Du Fu&rsquo;s poetry wasn&rsquo;t recognized as exceptional until hundreds of years later
his poetry is very biographical
wrote in regulated verse
~1400 of his poems have been recovered, ~1000 in regulated verse
his recovered works translated in english span ~3000 pages</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p>A Song on How My Thatched Roof Was Ruined by the Autumn Wind
In the high autumn skies of September
the wind cried out in rage,
Tearing off in whirls from my rooftop
three plies of thatch.
The thatch flew across the river,
was strewn on the floodplain,
The high stalks tangled in tips
of tall forest trees,
The low ones swirled in gusts across ground
and sank into mud puddles
The children from the village to the south
made a fool of me, impotent with age,
Without compunction plundered what was mine
before my very eyes,
Brazenly took armfuls of thatch,
ran off into the bamboo,
And I screamed lips dry and throat raw,
but no use.
(first half of poem)</p></blockquote><p>complaining about roof being blown down and kids stealin his thatch and his throat is dry
he talks about his symptoms, ails, sorrows</p><ul><li>he talked about his symptoms so much he&rsquo;s the oldest recognized case of diabetes based on his poems</li></ul><p>interesting perspective
he suffered from poverty, and now we know chronic illness</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p>A Song on How My Thatched Roof Was Ruined by the Autumn Wind cont.
&mldr;
Then I made my way home, leaning on staff,<br>sighing to myself.<br>A moment later the wind calmed down,<br>clouds turned dark as ink,<br>The autumn sky rolling and overcast,<br>blacker towards sunset,<br>And our cotton quilts were years old<br>and cold as iron,<br>My little boy slept poorly,<br>kicked rips in them.<br>Above the bed the roof leaked,<br>no place was dry,<br>And the raindrops ran down like strings,<br>without a break.<br>I have lived through upheavals and ruin<br>and have seldom slept very well,<br>But have no idea how I shall pass<br>this night of soaking<br>Oh, to own a mighty mansion<br>of a hundred thousand rooms,<br>A great roof for the poorest gentlemen<br>of all this world,<br>a place to make them smile<br>A building unshaken by wind or rain,<br>as solid as a mountain,<br>Oh, when shall I see before my eyes<br>a towering roof such as this?<br>Then I&rsquo;d accept the ruin of my own little hut<br>and death by freezing.</p></blockquote><p>aw man this is sad
despair and helplessness
wishes for something better
what he would give to see something better for others in his situation
mention of scholars
one of his most striking poems</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p>Recruiting Officer of Shih-hao
At dusk I sought lodging at Shih-hao village,
When a recruiting officer came to seize men at night.
An old man scaled the wall and fled,
His old wife came out to answer the door.<br>How furious was the officer’s shout!
How pitiable was the woman’s cry!
I listened as she stepped forward to speak:
“All my three sons have left for garrison duty at Yeh;
From one of them a letter just arrived,
Saying my two sons had newly died in battle.
Survivors can manage to live on,
But the dead are gone forever.
Now there’s no other man in the house,
Only a grandchild at his mother’s breast.
The child’s mother has not gone away;
She has only a tattered skirt for wear.
An old woman, I am feeble and weak,
But I will gladly leave with you tonight
To answer the urgent call at Ho-yang—
I can still cook morning gruel for your men.”<br>The night drew on, but talking stopped;
It seemed I heard only half-concealed sobs.
As I got back on the road at daybreak,
Only the old man was there to see me off.</p></blockquote><p>recruiters took people, people didnt want to go to war
grief and horror of war
the old man runs to escape recruitment, they take his wife instead</p><blockquote class=quote-callout><p>A Guest Arrives
North and south of my cottage, spring waters everywhere—
All I can see are a flock of terns that come day after day;
The flowery path has not been swept for any guests,
Only today do I finally open my gate for you.
The market is far, so our supper platter lacks variety,
Our family is poor, so the wine flask holds but old home-brew;
If you’re willing to sing with the gaffer next door,
I’ll call across the fence for him to finish the last cup.</p></blockquote><p>joy of being able to be with others
sadness he cant service his friends materially in the way he wants to</p><p>&ldquo;insultingly short introduction to Li Bai and Du Fu&rdquo;
