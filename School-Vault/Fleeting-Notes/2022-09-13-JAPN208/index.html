her translater, Ito, she never mentions any Japanese names
she at least admired the natural beauty of Japan
she describes people with a lot of weird descriptions like measurements of height and stuff
she describes the japanese people in terms of european standards
seemed like she really didnt wanna be there
she put a big emphasis at the start about being one of the first european woman to travel japan
gap in letters - we skipped some parts - her descriptions changed from negative to more respectful</p><a href=#article-about-bird><h5 id=article-about-bird><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>article about Bird</h5></a><p>(get link)

10 years into meiji era
japan was becoming more open to international affairs, travel, trade
recommended to travel for her health
autoethnography - officials and other Japanese people adopting European clothing</p><p>growing up Bird had spinal pain among other health issues, doctors recommended travel
see her prejudice against japanese through her writing
she was able to get an &ldquo;untainted&rdquo; view of japanese people, villages, culture
in tokyo/yokohama, meets with a lot of europeans -> mentions names of european people, but almost never japanese people
swarmed by natives who havent seen foreigners before in smaller villages
contact zone - the college in niigata
double contact zone - aino people affected by japanese govt, japanese govt affected by western forces
anti conquest - Bird is paving the way through these &ldquo;unbeaten tracks&rdquo; for more travellers
auto ethnography - aino people use japanese artifacts for their own significance</p><a href=#discussion-questions><h5 id=discussion-questions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>discussion questions</h5></a><p>what enabled Bird to go to japan? what made her interested in japan?</p><ul><li>port cities</li><li>infrastructure to take her to japan, to take care of her</li><li>her status as educated, good background, allowed her this opportunity</li><li>she had existing connections in japan, european people in tokyo she talked to</li><li>stories at this time that romanticize traveling to foreign lands, being the first to go there</li><li>unification of japan with meiji restoration allowed her to leave the port cities and travel the interior</li><li>steam boats - technology to enable travel</li></ul><p>it&rsquo;s pretty amazing that almost all of her journey she was walking or on horse
must have been very difficult
