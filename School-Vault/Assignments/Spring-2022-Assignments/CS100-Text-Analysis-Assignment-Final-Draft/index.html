I looked at:</p><ul><li>The House of the Dead (1862)</li><li>Notes from the Underground (1864)</li><li>Crime and Punishment (1866)</li><li>The Idiot (1869)</li><li>Demons (1872)</li><li>The Brothers Karamazov (1880)</li></ul><p>My goal was to see if concepts and motifs explored in Crime and Punishment were seen in Dostoevsky&rsquo;s works leading up to it and if these concepts permeated his later works. Many consider Crime and Punishment to be Dostoevsky&rsquo;s magnum opus, and I believe we will see its influence throughout his other works because of how strong of an impact it had.</p><p>I started by downloading text files of the six books and formatting them for analysis. I removed the extraneous information at the beginning and end of each book, but left the word &ldquo;ENDMARKER&rdquo; at the ends, as it would be useful later for the dispersion plots. In the python script, I took these text files and combined them into one string, keeping the texts in chronological order of when they were released.</p><a href=#word-clouds><h3 id=word-clouds><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Word Clouds</h3></a><p>I used word clouds in order to get a feel for the data and find any trends that were emerging. First, I made a word cloud with all six texts using the default stopwords list.
<a class="internal-link broken">Pasted image 20220410201133.png</a>
I kept creating clouds, and with each iteration, I added some of my own stopwords to the list, and finally, I removed Crime and Punishment in order to find what words were most common in the five books that I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with.
<a class="internal-link broken">Pasted image 20220410202221.png</a>
From this word cloud, I could start to see what kinds of themes showed up in Dostoevsky&rsquo;s works.</p><ul><li>I am not surprised that &rsquo;time&rsquo; is common, because throughout Crime and Punishment, the time was important to Raskolnikov and the events of the novel all happened within a timeline of a few weeks.</li><li>&lsquo;See&rsquo; might count as a stopword, but it could show how Dostoevsky finds importance in how characters perceive the world around them, and how perceptions and ideologies differ.</li><li>I think that it&rsquo;s strange that &lsquo;prince&rsquo; is the biggest word, but it must be used as an honorific. This surprised me because there is little reference to royalty in Crime and Punishment.</li></ul><a href=#dispersion-plots><h3 id=dispersion-plots><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Dispersion Plots</h3></a><p>Next, I split the texts up into tokens. This actually took a long time; I had to wait about ten minutes each time I ran this command. But once I had the text in a tokenized form, I could create text dispersion plots and analyze collocations and concordances.
<a class="internal-link broken">Pasted image 20220410211640.png</a>
I wanted to see how themes from Crime and Punishment showed up in the other texts, so I used a dispersion plot to find this. This graph shows all six novels in one timeline. In order to discern where one text ends and the other begins, I left the word &lsquo;ENDMARKER&rsquo; at the end of each book. By tracking the word &lsquo;ENDMARKER&rsquo; in the dispersion plot, we can conveniently split the graph into the six books. Crime and Punishment is the third section, roughly between the 100,000 and 200,000 word markers.</p><p>I picked the keywords for the first dispersion plot based on the ones that I thought would be interesting, and based the keywords in the second plot on words I found online in summaries of Crime and Punishment.
<a class="internal-link broken">Pasted image 20220410213642.png</a>
I had a few interesting takeaways from these graphs:</p><p>Similarities</p><ul><li>The word &lsquo;heard&rsquo; is used very often throughout Dostoevsky&rsquo;s works. I wanted to use this word because the idea of eavesdropping and listening to things you weren&rsquo;t supposed to is Dostoevsky&rsquo;s favorite form of coincidence in Crime and Punishment, and this data shows that listening is important in all of his works.</li><li>&lsquo;Money&rsquo; and &lsquo;God&rsquo; are also common themes throughout Dostoevsky&rsquo;s work, just like in Crime and Punishment.</li><li>St. &lsquo;Petersburg&rsquo; shows up often in Dostoevsky&rsquo;s work as well.</li></ul><p>Differences</p><ul><li>The words &lsquo;crime&rsquo; and &lsquo;punishment&rsquo; were not used most often in the actual book Crime and Punishment, but in the stories that came before it. After Crime and Punishment, we can see that they stop showing up as often.</li><li>After Crime and Punishment, the word &lsquo;confession&rsquo; becomes used more often, and &lsquo;repent&rsquo; follows the same trend, but is still used rarely. I believe if I had tracked different versions of these words, like &lsquo;repentance&rsquo; or &lsquo;confessing&rsquo;, I could find a more concise answer as to how the idea of repentance was used throughout Dostoevsky&rsquo;s works.</li><li>The word &lsquo;illness&rsquo; is used most often in Crime and Punishment, showing how dramatic Raskolnikov is!</li></ul><a href=#collocations-and-concordances><h3 id=collocations-and-concordances><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Collocations and Concordances</h3></a><p>Finally, I looked at the top collocations, as well as some concordances for words I was interested in.</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt> 1

Phrases like &lsquo;great deal&rsquo; and &rsquo;thousand rubles&rsquo; show money&rsquo;s importance, phrases like &rsquo;three days,&rsquo; &rsquo;long ago,&rsquo; and &rsquo;next day&rsquo; show time&rsquo;s importance, and phrases like &lsquo;convict prison&rsquo; and &lsquo;hard labour&rsquo; show punishment. I was not expecting the punishment-related phrases to show up as often as they did.</p><p>Finally, I looked at concordances. I chose &lsquo;Lazarus&rsquo; because I have found that the story is referenced in a lot of literary work, and wanted to see if Dostoevsky used it again. I also chose &lsquo;split&rsquo; and &rsquo;louse&rsquo; because they showed up a lot less in the dispersion plots than I thought they would, and wanted to see specifically where they were used.</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt> 1
