## [[Unbeaten Tracks In Japan]] discussion
##### initial thoughts
trains were still a big thing 150 years ago in japan
her translater, Ito, she never mentions any Japanese names
she at least admired the natural beauty of Japan
she describes people with a lot of weird descriptions like measurements of height and stuff
she describes the japanese people in terms of european standards
seemed like she really didnt wanna be there
she put a big emphasis at the start about being one of the first european woman to travel japan
gap in letters - we skipped some parts - her descriptions changed from negative to more respectful

##### article about Bird
(get link)
shows her travel route

##### presentations
1878
10 years into meiji era
japan was becoming more open to international affairs, travel, trade
recommended to travel for her health
autoethnography - officials and other Japanese people adopting European clothing

growing up Bird had spinal pain among other health issues, doctors recommended travel
see her prejudice against japanese through her writing
she was able to get an "untainted" view of japanese people, villages, culture
in tokyo/yokohama, meets with a lot of europeans -> mentions names of european people, but almost never japanese people
swarmed by natives who havent seen foreigners before in smaller villages
contact zone - the college in niigata
double contact zone - aino people affected by japanese govt, japanese govt affected by western forces
anti conquest - Bird is paving the way through these "unbeaten tracks" for more travellers
auto ethnography - aino people use japanese artifacts for their own significance

##### discussion questions
what enabled Bird to go to japan? what made her interested in japan?
- port cities
- infrastructure to take her to japan, to take care of her
- her status as educated, good background, allowed her this opportunity
- she had existing connections in japan, european people in tokyo she talked to
- stories at this time that romanticize traveling to foreign lands, being the first to go there
- unification of japan with meiji restoration allowed her to leave the port cities and travel the interior
- steam boats - technology to enable travel

it's pretty amazing that almost all of her journey she was walking or on horse
must have been very difficult
roads were not well kept
pg 67 "Good roads are really the most pressing need of Japan."

during her travel what did she pay attention to?
- scenery, landscapes, mountains, rice fields
	- "apparently the year she went was an usually rainy year"
- talks a lot about living conditions, what she liked or didnt, what commodities she missed, how other people lived, what made their health worse
- mentioned kuruma a lot - man-pulled cart
- talks about food, how she got used to it, how much she missed meat and european food
- does not talk about politics, economy, things that werent directly connected to her trip
- talks a lot about bodies, what people look like, facial structure
- appearance, clothes, differences in appearance
	- used quasi scientific language to describe these people she encounters
- differences in foreign influences vs the parts of japan that have not been influenced

what relations did she build with people in japan?
- she visits many different places and talks to many people
- doesnt really individualize japanese people, doesnt give names
- when crowds formed around to see her, very reverently
- two occasions where she helps sick children, word spreads, and then more people want her help
- description of aino people vs japanese people is very different
	- uses the words "savage" "ugly" "uncivilized" but then calls them "fascinating" "attractive"
	- takes a lot more time describing details of the aino; in othere locations she focused on western influence, but the aino did not yet have that influence
	- finds the aino superior, thinks they are stronger, thinks they look more like europeans than asians

through her writings, what can we tell about european sensibilities in the late 19th century?
- very different from today
- racism and prejudice
- used to cleanliness, not used to poverty
- not much diversity in britain, differences in appearance/ethnicity rarely seen
- always talking about clothing
- judging through appearances, not through actions
- different kinds of manners, ways to show respect
- did she enjoy her trip?
	- mixed feelings
	- complained a lot, but also had a lot of good things to say, especially about the manners/politeness of the japanese

we talked about contact zone and anti conquest last week. can we apply these concepts?
contact zone
- different levels of contact seen all throughout her journey in areas of different population
- bird herself was a moving contact zone
	- her letters represent contact in a eurocentric point of view
	- she met many japanese people for the first time, she was the first foreigner many of the japanese people had seen
	- there were crowds following her to see the foreigner
- tokyo
	- finding a translator, looking for people who speak english
	- many european there, lots of influence
- aino region, very little european contact
anti conquest
- in the preface, says her travel is for her own health, tries to justify the rest of her mixed opinions throughout the work
- says her work is intellectual to justify it, but her work can do harm
- european viewpoint, talks about how nice and respectful and polite japanese people are, but also says that they corrupt european children
- compared all the standards in japan to the ones she was used to in britain
- when she was traveling was she aware of the power she had?
	- doesnt seem like she is
	- very negligent of this land and these people, inhuman study of them, thinks they are lower than her
	- doesnt appreciate "insufficient english" that second language speakers had
	- her views dont change much from the beginning to the end

as a primary document, what values and significances does this book have?
- very eurocentric view, but one of the first views of someone from outside of japan experiencing the culture, land, people
- racist, but still provides information on japan among english speaking people
- biggest value is this is like a time capsule, including many aspects like what japan was like, difference in amount of contact throughout the country, european feelings toward japan, and more
- many primary travel logs like this come from soldiers, nobility, etc.; Bird is just a traveler, is able to focus on the "mundane" aspects
- shows difference in treatment of women in japanese culture vs european culture
- how does this work read to japanese people?
	- still useful, not many works like this even in japanese, not many writers that have traveled, especially since country is only recently starting to open up
	- gives insight to how rural japan lives
	- very valuable to english speaking readers outside of japan AND japanese speaking readers in japan

how would you summarize the reading in a word/phrase?
- honest
- englightening
- spiritual condition is much different than physical
- unique, novel
- biased

my summary
- (unintentionally) paving the way
	- one of the first to travel like this and write about it
	- paved the way for more to do it
	- not necessarily intentionally had this outcome
