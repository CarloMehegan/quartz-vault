- communism is not a threat to the us because
	- not hostile
	- far from america
	- will probably fall in a decade
- understanding of japanese culture and history
- overly pro western
- very insightful, many predictions turned out true

##### Questions for the reading [[Beyond Vietnam]]
- Who is the audience? WHen the author says "we" and "our," who are "we"?
	- americans
		- very us centric
	- the entire world
		- talks ab interconnectedness
	- not all americans
		- upper class americans, intellectual americans, elites, leaders, politicians
	- any westernized country
		- similar to the us
		- nato aligned countries
		- anti communist
		- spends a lot of time looking at misconceptions of communism that exists in these anti communist countries
- What is his agenda as a specialist of Japanese history and culture and American diplomat in Japan?
	- what does he want to accomplish?
	- what type of writing is this?
		- argumentative/persuasive
		- academic writing/scholarly
		- more subjective
	- implies that we should stop focusing time/energy/money on military like in vietnam
	- even within communism there are different motives/opinions, not just one big wave but therell be multiple smaller waves
	- doesnt view commmunism as a stable ideology, countries are using it not for the ideology but as a tool to gain power, shouldnt be focusing on the ideology as much as the authoritarianism
	- thinks communism isnt longterm/feasible
	- asia is not in the same situation as japan in terms of being capable of rapid development and modernizing
	- is he saying that asian countries grow under communism?
	- implication is that because these communist govts are autho. they can have influence on their country and enfore aggresive policy and kickstart their industry
	- current political regimes were stagnant, communism was a way of achieving progress while also not following western nationalism
	- is he trying to discredit communism?
	- not very explicit about his critique
	- people are giving communism too much credit bc it cant even sustain itself
	- people in asia dont understand the true nature of communism and he knows better than them
	- written in 1960s when communist revolutions in asia were giving people hope
	- people of asia were looking at communism for its short term benefits, he was looking at long term consequences
- What is his unit of analysis? Class, gender, nation, etc?
	- gnp gross national product
	- population
	- country
	- history - specifies countries histories, he thinks some asian countries decisions made due to their colonization by us and other countries
	- agricultusl production
	- im falling asleep
- What is the "Asian problem"? According to him, how did this problem develop? For whom is it a "problem"?
	- define it
	- blanket foreign diplomatic solution
	- didnt consider lack of resources, that industrialization was needed, different needs of asian countries
	- `The Korean War threatened to spead into a world holocaust. The Vietnam War still might. We cannot hope to have the truly peaceful world we all long for until Asia is closer to prosperity, stability, and peace.`
	- geopolitical problem
	- asia is not peaceful yet, not out of conflict
	- whats the relation between industrialization and peace?
	- you need both
	- in order to have peace, your country has to be industrialized
	- what is the link between these
	- fundamental misunderstanding the us has
	- because this is how the us did it this is how these countries should do it
	- us intervention ineffective because it didnt consider the specific these countries needed and how they were different form the us
	- viewing it through an american lens
	- society starts with individuals
	- assumption that in order to gain peace individuals need to be satisfied through consumption and consumption needs industrialization
	- in larger economies there will be international trade and wars make that difficult
	- does not want revolution
	- conflates commmunism with dictatorship, doesnt have to be, thats just how its been used, used in order to bring a dictatorship to power
- What knowledge of Japan and Asia does he intend to create through this narrative?
	- isabella bird influenced the view of japan when she published the writings about her travels in [[Unbeaten Tracks In Japan]], first time many people learned about japan
	- all asian nations are capable of industrializing, japan can be a model for that
	- stated that in the future likely that asian countries will become more powerful once they industrialize and to prevent them coming back for revenge they needed to combat the yellow peril in the us and promote trade, wanted to destigmatize asian trade and destigmatize asians as a whole
- How do you critique this narrative? Are there other ways of explaining the issues that he is addressing?
	- pretty accurate in what he predicted what might happen, criticism is using nations as unit of analysis, grouping together many different groups as one, talking about asia as a whole, over generalization
	- said communism wasnt really a threat, but wanted to promote trade, promoting global capitalism
	- japan as an outlier, model nation
	- anti conquest
	- no other opinions, especially from asia, could have included for example what a chinese diplomat/elite thought and countered those arguments
	- doesnt address dictatorships under capitalism
	- industrialization and capitalism leading to peaceful society - says thats the right way because thats how the us did it

how do you summarize the reading in a few words?
- lots of assumptions
- seemingly convincing
- industrialization equals prosperity
- communism not scary
- american perspective
