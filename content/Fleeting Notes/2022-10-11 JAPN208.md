last time talked about [[Into the Light]] and [[National Language, Imperialization, and the Gendered Aporia of Empire]], talked about people immigrating to japan
will spend the next few classes talking about japanese people immigrating to america

## Japanese in America I
- Understand the history of Japanese immigration to the United States since the late 19th century
- Read and discuss Eiichiro Azuma's "Japanese Immigrant Settler Colonialism...Yellow Peril" long ass title

##### The Japan They Left
- Japan in the late 19th century
	- integrated into global capitalism
	- as discussed before in class. signed unequal treaties for international exchange
	- Meiji Restoration
- Socio-economic change brought by Meiji Restoration
	- land tax reform of 1873 and private ownership of land
	- before this, peasants of a village owned the land together, paid taxes together with the village being a unit, taxes paid in rice, calculated based on actual harvest
	- after this, introduction of individual ownership and tax, taxes paid in currency, calulated based on assessed value
	- doesnt matter how much rice each village makes each year; tax is fixed; 3%, very high for peasants; reduced later to 2.5%
	- with individual tax system, cant get help from others when you have a bad harvest
	- new taxation not popular among peasants, many became poorer
- Seinan War, 1877
	- civil war within japan
	- seinan = "southwest"
	- largest samurai rebellion in japan
	- many frustrated samurai who didnt obey new Meiji govt
	- Kyushu island
	- govt eventually suppressed the rebellion, but had to spend a lot of money
	- increased government spending $\rightarrow$ more money printed
	- led to severe inflation
- Matsukata reform and deflation, 1881-
	- Matsukata was a finance minister
	- implemented fiscal reform to calm down inflation
	- resulted in severe deflation
	- this deflation put peasants in trouble
	- many peasants couldnt pay tax because value of goods dropped
- Impoverished farmers sell land, leave for cities, emigrate abroad...
	- those in cities become wage laborers
	- industries were growing in cities, required labor
	- shift towards industrial economy from agrarian economy
	- others left japan, went to places like Hawaii, the United States, as early as 1880s
- First government sponsored emigration to Hawaii, 1885; followed by immigration to US mainland
	- govt encouraged people to move to these places
	- as population grew, fear that japan was too small, not enough jobs/food for all these people

##### Japanese Government Criteria for Emigration to Hawaii, 1885
- primary source, criteria for those who want to emigrate
	- "The emigrant laborer shall meet the following conditions"
	- "A person who falls under any of the under-mentioned catergories shall not be eligible for recruitment"
	- couldnt bring kids, must be single or married with no dependents
		- didnt give enough money to support kids
	- cant suffer from chronic diseases
		- tuberculosis was spreading, no cure at the time
- shows how japan govt was not just encouraging people, but selecting people to work outside of the country

##### Japanese Americans within Asian American History/Context
Chinese immigrants and other Asian immigrants also coming to the United States at this time
- The Chinese Exclusion Act, 1882
	- banned immigration of chinese laborers/workers to the United States
	- anti asian sentiment was growing in the US
- First government sponsored emigration to Hawaii, 1885; followed by immigration to US mainland
	- as of 1885 Hawaii was still an independent kingdom
	- 1898 Hawaii was incorporated into American territories
	- sugarcane and coffee farming in Hawaii
	- many japanese laborers started farming businesses in Hawaii
- The Asiatic Exclusion League, 1905
	- started in california, san francisco
	- many japanese people were moving to california
	- promoted anti asian sentiment
	- idea that asian workers who were willing to work for cheap wages were stealing jobs from white american workers
		- sounds familiar (im gonna die)
- Criticism of Japanese Immigrants by the Asiatic Exclusion League, 1908
	- primary source example
	- "While the Japanese are engaged in every occupation,... and solicit the patronage of the whites, they trade exclusively with themselves and their earnings and profits, except so musch as is spent for absolute necesseities, finds its way to Japan ador investment..."
	- similar rhetoric to today (we live in a society)
	- fearmongering
	- complaining about how cheap everything is now even though that benefits them (i hate mondays)
	- painting each group as cohesive; there are white workers getting paid dirt too
- Segregation of Japanese children from public schools in San Francisco, 1906
	- couldnt attend same public schools as white kids
	- american sense of superiority to japanese
	- "solution these govts came up with is very interesting"
- Gentlemen's Agreement, 1907
	- Japanese migration to Brazil increases
	- basically ends emigration to the United States
	- workers could no longer come to the US unless to join family living there or continuing previously acquired work
	- instead of the US banning japanese immigration, japan decided to stop it
	- japan govt wanted the people already in the US to be treated fairly
	- US govt settles with this
	- number of japanese immigrants to the united states dropped sharply, many went to Brazil/South America instead
	- 1930s, some moved to Manchuria
	- Japanese workers currently in america at this point were young single men
	- couldnt marry white women, but japanese women couldnt move to the united states without passports
	- many japanese men's families found wives for them in japan, who then moved to the US to unite with them without having ever met before; "picture bride"
- Immigration Act of 1924
	- introduced quota system for number of immigrants of each country/nationality, set at 2% of population of each country/nationality already in the US as of 1890 national census
	- 1890! that was so long ago
	- favored immigrants from european, already developed countries
