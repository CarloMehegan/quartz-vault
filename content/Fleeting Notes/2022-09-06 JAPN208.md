## Writing about travel
##### How to conceptualize and analyze travel?
- travel often seen as personal matter: enlightenment, global capitalism, etc.
	- on one level travel is a personal matter, you travel because you want to/need to for personal reasons
	- enlightenment - human beings are free and can make autonomous decisions
	- global capitalism - international travel is easier
	- obligatory pandemic made it difficult
- travel as the lens through which to look at "bigger issues"
	- in [[Imperial Eyes]], imperialism
		- looking at many people's travel writing with the bigger purpose of exploring issues of imperialism
	- international trade
	- disease
	- persecution
	- education
- need to analyze in context - political, socio-economic, and cultural
- when examining travel from one country to another, we can take into consideration:
	- diplomatic relation between the two countries
	- history between the two countries
	- economic condition of each country
	- source of funding
	- cultural images of those countries

##### [[Imperial Eyes]]
purpose of this reading for us is to gain some terms and concepts for our analysis of travel writings in the upcoming weeks

what kind of source?
- secondary, because Pratt is analyzing other sources, interpreting other data

what are the author's motivations and goals?
- analyzing the european bias in travel writing

terms from the reading

###### contact zone
- a zone where two cultures encounter
- synonymous with term "colonial frontier"
- often one culture is indigenous
- uneven power balance
- comes from the linguistic term [[Language Change III|Contact Language]]; a language that emerges when two cultures encounter, usually for trade and such

###### anti-conquest
- the European bourgeois seeking to secure their innocence while also asserting their power
- the "seeing-man" - "he whose imperial eyes passively look out and possess"
- helps the bourgeois feel more comfortable and justified in their actions
- "im just a silly little foreigner traveling in a foreign land"
- could also be justified as missionary work - spreading the word of God
- propaganda to trivialize the power imbalance

###### autoethnography / autoethnographic expression
- "instances in which colonized subjects undertake to represent themselves in ways that engage with the colonizer's own terms"
- ex. the *New Chronicle* talked about in the reading
- not thought of as authentic or autochtonous forms of self-representation
- "If ethnographic texts are a means by which Europeans represent to themselves their (usually subjugated) others, autoethnographic texts are those the others construct in response to or in dialogue with those metropolitan representations"
- ex. enlightenment is a European idea; people outside of Europe using the terms of Enlightenment to represent themselves and fight against imperialism

"is the internet a contact zone?" - question somebody asked


on thursday, lecture on bird's unbeaten track, complete reading by tuesday for discussion
the next 3 readings are travel logs, primary sources
