description:: discussing [[Peony Pavilion]] and [[Peach Blossom Fan]]

reading today was
- The Peony Pavillion
- The Peach Blossom Fan
- Biography of Actor Ma

i didnt look at them eep also im like 8 min late to class bc fire alarm went off

also we're in much more recent history now, 1700s, 1800s, 1900s

##### The Peony Pavillion
- set in tsung dynasty
- very slow
	- like 55 scenes
	- very uncommon to see the entire thing performed at once
	- performance of the play in new york a few years ago was like 12 hours long thats pretty quick
	- a dvd of the full thing produced was like 30 hours long
	- intended for coneissuers, for elite consumption
- plot about like
	- dreams and lovers and a emperor and death and uhh im not following and the exams and theyre destined to marry each other and the guy is arrested but he passes the exams and is released and marries the girl whatevr
- Mei Lanfang
	- 1894-1961
	- played the main girl
	- men were traditionally actors, men famously played women
	- very famous actor
- these plays tend to be so infused with meaning
	- actors and actresses are trained with a very detailed set of structured movements that are meant to contain deep feeling
	- hand gestures
- scene 7
	- this was the reading i think
	- Scene 7: The Schoolroom
	- we meet a tutor
		- "Kaun-kuan cry the ospreys / on the islet in the river"
	- thats a poem we talked about from the Shijing, classis of poetry, that i dont have a link for for some reason
	- tutor is teaching whats their name about poetry and stuff
	- vulgarity and humor
	- how common was it for women to be educated, and pass the exams?
		- upper class thing, with the expectation theyd be able to educate themselves

##### The Peach Blossom Fan (The Background)
- a historical play, abotu historical events, that happened within the living memory of the author (or their parents); recent
- story about infighting of higher individuals that may have led to the downfall of the Ming dynasty (turned into Qing dynasty)
- takes place in nanjing during ming dynasty
- similar style/form as the peony pavillion (i didnt catch what the type of play is called)
- Kong Shangren 1648-1718
	- most known for this play
	- he was a descendant of confucius
- The Fall of the Ming Dynasty
	- a eunuch guy that became good friends with the emperors wetnurse(?) and climbs up in rank and gains a lot of power
	- idea of eunuchs coming to more power than they should is linked to the fall of dynasties; almost a trope at this point!
	- where they draw the beginning of the fall of the ming
- Hou Fangyu and Li Xiangjun
	- two main characters
	- hou fangyu a guy travelling thru wherver during whatever, part of a society aimed at rooting corruption out of the govt
	- falls in love with a girl named Li Xiangjun
	- in reality relationship happened way after play is set
	- Hou Fangyu takes the imperial exams and fails
- Ruan Dacheng 1587-1646
	- famous dramatist
	- well known literati
	- takes a role in the southern ming opposition govt, against the current established govt
	- clown archetype of character aka the villain
	- presented as evil
	- tries to set up marriage between hou fangyu and li xiangjun to get on his good side or something but it backfires or something
- beijing falls (what!)
- restoration society hou fangyu is a part of falls
- uh anyways very complicated dramatic play
- Shi Kefa 1601-1645(?)
	- presented in the story as having the souther ming ports best interests
	- presented as a good guy
	- historically led one of the very last stands of the ming dynasty
	- historically one of the worst massacres thats ever happened when the city _ is raided i didnt hear which by Qing troops
	- in the Qing dynasty, the dynasty he fought against, revered as a paramount loyal official
		- you want your govt full of shi kefas and not the people who collaborated against the govt

##### The Peach Blossom Fan (The Object)
- theres a fan in the play!
- conveys very significant meaning in the story, almost fetishized
- early in the play, hou fangyu gives li xiangjun the fan
- later she attempts to commit suicide for reasons (dacheng tries to punish hou fangyu by having li xianjun married to someone else), she hits her head on a pillar and bleeds on the fan
- another character takes the blood and paints peach blossoms on it and sends to hou fengyu
- hou fengyu says the fan is more valuable than his own life

##### The Peach Blossom Fan (The Text)
- prologue starts with an old man, set in 1684, like 20 years after events of the play(?) after fall of the ming dynasty
	- old man used to be a master of ceremonies, talks about how good life is rn
	- "The sun beams brightly on a world well governed."
	- story that valorizes people that fought hard against the Qing dynasty
	- is this an affective way to open a play?
		- covering your bases
		- people reading the play were elites, educated
		- dangerous to talk about ppl who fought against the dynasty
		- author wrote this bit to keep it safe
		- had more protection bc he was a descendant of confucius
		- "this play couldve never been written in the 1660s" not until like 1670s the qing got rid of most of their opposition
	- setting the scene, describing nature
		- when these plays were performed, didnt have sets
- play start
- ch'en and wu gossiping about latest news on the bandits
- ming dynasty doesnt have the troops to fight these forces
- "The fate of the dynasty is sealed. We might as well enjoy the spring while it lasts,"
- how is this different from how history has been talked about in previous readings?
	- pretty direct, in other readings it was about using older stories to allude to whats happening
	- "here it feels like two dudes in a bar talking about the war in ukraine"
		- happening nearby, but still far away
		- more distant
	- interaction with real events is a constant thread throughout the play, talking about the news
	- a sense of not knowing for sure whats really happening

##### Takeaways
which of these plays do you like better?
- dont like the fatalism in the peach blossom fan
- liked second one more for pretentious reasons, pretentious historical fiction
is there anything different we've seen from these two plays?
- historical fiction plays take off around the late ming dynasty
- most plays not super historical
- in ming dynasty, more and more fascination with retelling historical events
- interesting about peach blossom fan is that it retells recent history at the time, within living memory, like 30-40 years after
- these arent plays being performed in the marketplace, more highbrow
