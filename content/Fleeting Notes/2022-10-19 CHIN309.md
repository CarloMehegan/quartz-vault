##### Song Dynasty 960-1279

- but still respected for innovation in many areas, including literary
- two halves
	- northern song, 960-1127, capital moves to _
	- southern song, 1127-1279

##### aside: Qingming Shanghetu
famous painting

debated what is depicted, but may show the Song dynasty capital
extremely lojng painting, as you move right to left, follows river into the city

##### Ci Lyric Poetry
- main innovation of this kind of poetry
	- more flexible than regulated verse in certain ways
- set pattern of tones and rythm
- pattern depends on the title
	-  title shows us how rhymes pattern stuff happens
	- another layer of complexity
	- difficult kind of poem to write, only a few people were considered masters of the form
- known for being emotional
	- express desire

##### Ouyang Xiu 1007-1072
- known for reform, travelled around china
- career full of lots of ups and downs
- ancient style writing
	- wanted his works to be legible to more people, and more people could read ancient style
	- he was an examiner in the imperial exams
	- flunked people that used the newer styles of writing
- The New Tang History
	- rewriting the history of the tang, put in charge of this work
	- huge role, people looked to these works for how to govern

##### Drunk in Fairyland
- "i forgot to put the page numbers of the poems in the syllabus" so awesome i didnt even check it man
	- pg 158 in columbia reader
- Tune: "Drunk in Fairyland"
	- title tells us about the rhyme, rythtm
- written by Ouyang Xiu
- "Shyly she knits her brows / And shows a face delicately rouged:"
	- goodness
	- about an affair
	- unorthodox to have serious poetry about this topic at this time
- "I've needlework to do for mother"
	- "women existed in private life"
	- women would embroider, etc to contribute to family
- doesnt really mention the male figure, "out of frame"
- neither character isnt really described, just their actions
- so whats the title mean?
	- written to the tune "drunk in fairyland"
	- like writing to the tune of twinkle twinkle little star
	- the origin of many of these tunes are unclear
	- dont have music for most of these

##### The Three Zithers
- poetry is the most respected, highest form of writing in chinese litterature
- people engage in poetry different from other writings
- here is a prose writing from Ouyang Xiu
- writing about his family's three zithers
- "one doesnt need three zithers"
- "ouyang presents this as an embarrassment of riches"
- "But the important thing about a zither, after all, is how it sounds, not who made it."
- one has gold studs, jade studs, stone studs
- having gold and jade studs is too much
- an old man should only need a zither with stone studs

##### A Record of the Pavilion of an Intoxicated Old Man
- one of his monikers is intoxicated old man
- poetic description of this place away from sight
- speaking of himself in third person
- intoxicated not from wine but from being near the water and mountains
- getting drunk on life
- reminds me of the poems we read about before about nature
