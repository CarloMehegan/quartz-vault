##### Korea Under Japanese Rule
japanese colonialism in korea
have talked about japanese colonialism for the last few classes, focusing specifically today on korea

Japan's annexation of Korea, 1910
- Korea becomes part of the Japanese empire
- ends in 1945 with end of world war

- tried to assimilate koreans
- banned korean publications, banned teaching korean in schools
- didnt work, lots of resistance

Paris Peace Conference, 1918
- **"national self-determination"** fuels nationalism and independence movements in colonies
- colonial powers were not interested in applying this principle to their colonies
- idea started in europe, spread to colonies in asia
- self-determination = right for a country to choose its own govt, how its ruled, independence
- very few places in the world at this time that could practice this principle
- promoted first by Woodrow Wilson

March First Movement, 1919
- triggered by death of King Gojong of Choson dynasty
	- monarch of korea from 1864 to 1907, died jan 21 1919
- huge resistance movement
- around the same time, another large scale anti-imperialist independence movement took place in China

"Cultural Accommodation," 1919-1937

- new approach to control
- instead of suppressing everything, giving some kinds of freedom/autonomy
- Korean newspapers and magazines allowed
- Koreans recruited into bureaucracy (local govt, police)

	- big event; even in mainland Japan, only ~5 national universities
	- "no national unis in america - most prestigious unis"
- Male universal suffrage, 1925
	- voting right for Korean men living in **metropole**
	- metropole = the parent state of a colony; here, mainland Japan
	- Japanese women didn't gain voting rights for another ~20 years
	- "gender was a bigger obstacle than ethnicity"


##### Korean Migration to Japan
Large scale migration starts after annexation
- 40,000 by 1920

Economic boom in Japan in WWI era

- textile, shipbuilding, mines
- many jobs, labor shortage; attracted korean migrants
- during WWI european nations couldnt attend to their asian colonies, japan profited from this by selling to these colonies
- "pull factor"

Surplus agrarian population in Korea
- "push factor"
- poverty in agrarian villages in Korea
- "didnt exist naturally"
- poverty artifically made when Japan annexed Korea
	- confiscated/expropriated land
	- farmers lost land, had to find jobs, move to cities
	- created social unrest

Kantō earthquake, 1923
- large scale earthquake hit the Kanto region in Japan
- >100,000 people died, not because of earthquake itself, but fire that followed it
- many neighborhoods destroyed
- massacre of koreans in Tokyo and Yokohama
- provided tokyo city govt with opportunity to completely rebuild tokyo
- rumors that fire caused by korean conspiracies, koreans targeted by militia
- social unrest
