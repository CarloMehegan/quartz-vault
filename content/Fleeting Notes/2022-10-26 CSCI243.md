description:: more algorithms; find number in a list

pseudocode
what is pseudocode
....why are we talking ab this
i guess for writing out algorithms
yes
use pseudocode for sketching out algorithms
last time algorithm to find maximum number in a list

algorithm
has input
does stuff

if we had multiple numbers that were equal to the max in the max algorithm which value would be returned
- the first in the list with that max value bc we say if max < next number then replace max
- if we said is max equal to or less than, then we would be returning the last number equal to max

what if n = 0? check for that and return an exception or soemthing

execution time
in the worst case is n comparisons + n assignments = $nc_1 + nc_2 = n(c_1+c_2)$
i.e., $O(n)$


ok new example
ex search for int x among unordered list of n integers

this is basically like finding the max except we know from the start what number we are looking for
we can look for it and terminate as soon as we find it
worst case is it is not in the list

function searchForInt (a1, a2, ... an)
i = 1
while (i <= n and x does not equal ai)
	i = i+1

if i less than or equal to n
	location = i
else
	location = 0
return location



new ex
ex. search for int x among ordered! list of n integers

binary search!
seen in cs241 but i dont remember
cutting the list in half, find which half x is in, keep cutting till you find x

i = 1
j = n
location = 0

while (i $\leq$ j and location=0)
	m = floor($\frac {i+j} 2$)
	if x > $a_m$ 
		then i = m+1
	else if x < $a_m$
		then j = m
	else
		location = m
return location

we did it, $O(logn)$ time
