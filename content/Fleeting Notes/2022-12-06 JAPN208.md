description:: discussing [[Our School]]

i actually did the reading (watched the documentary) and did the online comments
too bad thats only 2 online comments done
maybe i can email him and ask if i can make up those

initial thoughts
- it was good
- not what i was expecting thought it would be a lot of propaganda and anti north korean stuff but it was more subtle
- entertaining because of the kids
- students have a more fluid sense of identity - switching between korean and japanese

presenters
1
- theme of identity
	- wearing traditional uniform even though it is cold
	- educational frontline
		- thats similar to [[The Only Woman in the Room]] with the german and american schools in japan
	- clothes give identity
	- symbolic of a lot of the things we've talked about
- why am i korean?
- finding belonging
2
- zainichi
- opportunity to learn about heritage through the school
- parallels to [[Into the Light]]
- identity
3
- students in sapporo hokkaido
- had a good time in north korea, super happy trip, unlike the things theyd heard before
- the students have an interesting perspective because theyve lived outside of north korea so theyre heard about all the bad
4
- the school is very different from say a US school
- teachers have parental relationship with students
- students retain the same peers for up to 12 years, become like family
- theme of identity
- students seem happy, some seem to express discomfort in their identity
- they dont talk about the students that leave to go to japanese schools
- the school size has shrunk
- reason for the decline is never mentioned - contributes to the weird hidden feelings
- school received death threats
- children were never at fault for what was happening

questions
- What does this documentary say about identity?
	- second gen in america would consider themselves american, but here, third generation doesnt want to be considered japanese at all
	- use the word chosen to talk about korea, which aligns more with north korea; different word for south korea; clear distinction in japanese/korean between the two koreas
	- in japan, japanese people still viewed them as solely koreans
	- in north korea, they were accepted as if solely korean
	- they only made the girls wear the traditional dress
	- wanted identity to be stronger with women, who would eventually become mothers and pass down the culture/identity; discussed when looking at [[National Language, Imperialization, and the Gendered Aporia of Empire]] how korean mothers were given role of disseminating japanese language; this is like a parallel/opposite of that
	- women are expected to play a greater role in terms of preservation/dissemination of culture
	- one girl said wearing traditional dress helped her feel more strongly about her korean identity; some did like it
	- today, in japan, women wear kimonos to formal events, but you never see men wearing kimonos, usually suits
- homeland/patriotism
	- idealizing homeland, placing it on a pedestal; many people do this, not just here with north korea; nostalgic affection
	- didnt seem forced, propagandish, wouldnt know this was a north korean school until you see the flag; very voluntary form of patriotism; not forced
	- but it runs deep
	- forced on them by circumstance; they were raised by north korean families; not directly forced but many forces that have influenced them since birth
	- whats causing the decline in number of students attending? is it parents being scared of discrimination for their kids?
	- some kids are super young, cant make the decision to go away to this school
- trip to north korea
	- they were treated better there, accepted more than in japan, easy to see how it would strengthen their loyalty
	- bonds they had with north koreans they met was similar to bonds with teachers at the school
	- "felt artificially cultivated" would be interesting in seeing this trip from the side of north korea and how mmuch effort and resources were put into giving these kids a feeling of loyalty
	- north korea is known for the curated trips
	- they barely see anybody else outside of their group even in the big open central spots that seem touristy
	- its curated but still wholesomel the trip had a lot of significance to them
	- plastic
	- they must be aware of the artificial aspect but still genuinely having a good experience
	- they cry when theyre leaving; only were there for like under a week but still developed a fast bond
	- "how many people in my life have i met that cried when i said goodbye to them?" lol
- colonialism
	- they are resisting colonialism through the school and connecting to north korea
	- resistance to colonization in a modern period, in terms of being forced to assimilate into japanese society
	- "japanese society is very homogenous; easy to slip into japanese state of mind and this is a way to fight against that"
	- colonialism and discrimination with the sports - they set records but werent recognized for them because they were korean and not japanese
	- could tell they really cared about the sports, outside of any nationalistic pressures
	- would you like to go to the school, a school like this?
	- almost everything they do contributes to this cultivation of national identity
	- "i wonder whether all students actually fit this school neatly"
	- is there any tension among students, teachers, about north korea?
	- theyre being isolated from japanese society
	- tension between students transferring in and out, seems to be many people coming in and out
	- film focuses on 12th grade but looks like there is fluidity
	- what about lgbt students and others who might be discriminated against within the school?

how would you describe the doc in a few words?
- question of identity
- pride
- isolated
- distinct
- pressure
- focus on individual (not much talk about nk govt)
- preservation
- northern gothic - because this reminds me so much of southern gothic literature with the feeling of like avoiding the underlying problems the past has caused


come next class with something to say about final paper - some kind of thesis or argument or something you want to write about
