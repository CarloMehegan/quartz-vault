uhhh i wasnt paying attention what are we doing

pigeonhole

ex. for any positive integer n, there is a multiple of n that contains only 0s and 1s.

proof: for positive integer n consider the following n + 1 integers
1, 11, 111, ... , 1...1
where the last number contains n + 1 1s. note that there are n remainders, 0, ... , n-1,, when an integer is divided by n (ie mod n $\in$ {0, ..., n-1})
by the pigeonhole principle, among the n+1 numbers in our list there must be two numbers a and b with a > b with the same remainder when divided by n
so a - b is divisible by n, thus a multiple of n and a-b contains only 0s and 1s.

this makes not a lot of sense at all what a weird ass proof


another pigeonhole ex.

In a month of 30 days, a baseball team plays at least one game a day but no more than 45 games in the month. Show that there must be a period of some number of consecutive days during which the team plays exactly 14 games.

Consider a calendar of 30 days with a 1 (representing games) on each day
Want to show that its not possible to add up to 15 more ones while avoiding having 14 consecutive ones

i dont get it it just says some period of consecutive days
can it be literally any sequence of days
how could 14 not be even considered possible
i dont understand
