Tokugawa elite's interactions with Americans and Europeans

#person
##### Fukuzawa Yukichi 1835-1901
important scholar, philosopher, educator
now on Japan's 10,000 yen bill (highest value)
- people on 10,000 yen bills are important historic figures
- "like george washington being on the one dollar bill"

samurai, *rangaku* scholar, educator
- rangaku = "dutch learning"
- why dutch scholar?
	- before any other Western countries, Japan would trade with the Netherlands
	- the dutch were protestant and promised not to spread Christianity, focus on business
	- Tokugawa govt allowed trade with the dutch, but only on one small island, port of Nagasaki
	- only trade at this port from 1640s-1840s
	- "the dutch's status was very different back then"
- when trade opened to the West, not many knew English, but there were Japanese people that knew Dutch

born in Osaka, 1835
- high traffic for trade
- father was a low ranking samurai from Nakatsu domain in Kyushu
- samurais were paid in rice before cash economy
- Fukuzawa's father had rice storage in Osaka for trade
grew up in northern Kyushu

ordered to go to Edo (present day Tokyo) by the daimyo of Nakatsu domain, 1858
- opens a private school for samurai and teaches rangaku
	- Keio University
- participated in mission to the US and Europe in late Tokugawa era

focused on education after the Meiji Restoration
- promoted Western liberalism and democracy
	- constitutionalism, political parties, gender equality, meritocracy
- *Datsu-A ron*
	- Datsu = to escape, A = Asia, ron = theory
	- pushed this idea that Japan has to leave Asia and become more Western, adapt to Western civilization
	- pretty common idea at his time


##### Japanese Embassy to the United States 1860
sent by Tokugawa Shogunate, 1860, to ratify the Treaty of Amity and Commerce

left Shinagawa on February 9, 1860
- crossed the pacific on US navy's frigate Powhatan and Tokugawa gov's Rinkan-maru
	- Rinkan-maru built in the Netherlands

recommended further reading
Japan-NYC 1860-2010: A Heritage of Friendship
https://www.ny.us.emb-japan.go.jp/150JapanNY/en/about.html
can also search New York Times articles from the time, on how Japanese delegates were received - fascinated by unique clothing, hairstyle


##### Japanese Embassy to Europe 1862
sent by Tokugawa Shogunate, 1862, to ratify the treaties as well, but also to delay the opening of treaty ports and cities (Edo and Osaka)
japan wanted to postpone as much as possible, minimize the impact of westerners in japanese society

"do you understand these fears?"
China had similar fears of opening up country to trade
fear of being dependent, want to be self sufficient
fear of the govts rule being challenged by outside forces
still aware that japan couldn't stay isolated forever

travelled on British navy frigate Odin
Fukuzawa participated as a translator/interpreter
visited Britain, France, Netherlands, Prussia, Portugal, Russia
- "must have been a tiring trip"
- in london, visited international exhibition, british museum, buckingham palace, etc.
- experienced how western countries were more advanced; japan couldn't just stay isolated; this realization became a **major driving force for change**


##### Iwakura Mission, December 1871 - September 1873
in new Meiji govt now
108 people sent to the US and Europe by the *Meiji govt*
western civilization
- political economic military and scientific knowledge
goal of revision of unequal treaties
- not successful in revision

##### [[Fukuzawa's Autobiography]]
questions to consider when reading
- What did Fukuzawa see in the US and Europe? What did he not see
	- what would you be curious to see if you were there?
- How does he observe and evaluate American and European culture?
- What sensibilities can we identify in Fukkuzawa's observation?
	- how do they contrast from Bird's sensibilities?
- How can we apply the notion of "contact zone" to our reading of this text?
	- "contact zones" in Japan vs in US
	- also, anti conquest and autoethnography
- Through the reading of Bird and Fukuzawa, what can we tell about international relations (West-Asia relations particularly) in the late 19th century?
	- Fukuzawa is more explicit than Bird in talking about politics

for online comments
- this is a primary reading
	- from syllabus "for a primary reading discuss what the main themes are and how you can relate the reading to the issues and concepts that we have studied in class"
