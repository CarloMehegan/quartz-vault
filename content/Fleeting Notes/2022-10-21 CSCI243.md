description:: growth rates, big-omega, big-theta

more growth rates of functions


a function grows at the rate of its largest power, called the degree
eventually the largest power is the only part that matters
he does a proof for it that takes a while and im not gonna write it
see the Intuitively: part in the notes

examples see pg 25
1. 1 + 2 + ... + n
   less than or equal to n + n + ... n = $n^2$
   so $O(n^2)$
2. n!
   $1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n$
   less than or equal to $n * n * n * ... * n$
   so $O(n^n)$
3. n = $O(2^n)$
   $\rightarrow$ log$n$ = $O(n)$
   also n = $(Ob^n) \rightarrow log_bn = O(n)$
4. $n^m$
   $log n^m$
   $= m log n = O(n)$
   this is why log is so powerful
   $logn^{10000} = O(n)$
5. $n^m = O(2^n)$
   because if you apply log on both sides $m log n = n log 2$
   $\rightarrow O(log n) = O(n)$
6. $(logn)^m = O(n)$
   i dont get this one but ok cool

$lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac {f(n)} {g(n)}$
if f is bigger then $= \infty$
if g is bigger then $= 0$
could also be a constant

##### Big Omega
$\Omega$
$f(x) = \Omega (g(x))$
iff there exists 2 constants $c, k$ :
$f(x) \leq cg(x)$ for all $x \geq k$

##### Big Theta 
Big-$\Theta$
$f(x) = \Theta (g(x))$
iff there exists 3 constants $c_1, c_2, k$ :
$c_1 g(x) \leq f(x) \leq c_2 g(x)$ for all $x \geq k$

WHAT are we talking about


ex $x^2 + 2x + 1 = ?(3x^2)$
what symbol should we use
$\rightarrow$ should use $\Theta$
because grow at same rate

$3x = \Theta(x)$
$3x = \Omega(x)$
$3x = O(x)$
**all three are true**, the **strongest is Theta**, so use that

ex $x^2 = ?(x^3)$
$\rightarrow x^2 = O(x^3)$

what

$(logn)^m$
m = constant
how does this relate to $n$
take ratio logn to the m over n
whats the limit n to infty of logn to the m over n
lhospital rule
lim of any ratio function is equal to whatever
hes talking about number 6 from earlier


constants < poly logs < polynomials < exponentials
