## The Nisei and Japanese American Soldiers
- Talked last time about Issei, first generation
- Nisei means second generation of japanese in america
- Nisei were full american citizens by being born there, Issei were not

##### Internment of Japanese/Japanese Americans
- WWII in Europe, 1939
- US-Japanese relation deteriorates as Japan expands to Southeast Asia
	- i remember this bc i watched history of japan again last night
- Munson Report, submitted to White House, Oct 1941
	- didnt conclude that they were a threat
	- the nisei "show a pathetic eagerness to be Americans"
- Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Dec 7, 1941
- Suspicious "enemy aliens" arrested by FBI
	- including Germans and Italians
- Military and business leaders insist on Japanese evacuation from West Coast
	- evacuation of whole japanese communities
	- not on the same scale for german/italian communities
- Executive Order 9066, Feb 1942
	- issued by Roosevelt
	- authorized evacuation and internment of japanese from Washington, Oregon, California, and Arizona
	- Map of Exclusion Areas![[Pasted image 20221020141707.png]] 
- More than 120,000 Japanese evacuated from the West Coast by the WRA
- 10 Relocation Centers
	- seen above as the red triangles
	- Manzanar, Poston were big ones
	- Tule Lake became where "troublemakers" were sent
	- Isolation centers seen above as black squares, were for troublemakers before Tule Lake took that role
- Japanese evacuated from Latin American countries as well
	- Mexico, Peru, more
	- Allied with the United States
	- Brazil had their own policies

##### Life in the Camps
- Existing tension between the Issei and Nisei
	- many people were just traveling
	- many people planned to go back home after working for a while
	- these people were included as Issei
	- Nisei were regular citizens
	- tension existed before the war, intensified in the camps
- Mike Masaoka (Nisei Japanese, National Secretary of the Japanese American Citizens League) statement on Japanese Evacuation, 1942
	- supported the evacuation
	- "feels like a forced statement"
	- "loyal to the US"
- WRA nominates JACL leaders as representatives of the entire Japanese community
	- fueled tensions
- Uprising in Manzanar, Dec 1942
	- large scale uprising, frustration over treatment by WRA
	- important turning point in how Japanese Americans were treated
- WRA conducts "loyalty review," Feb 1943
	- govt starts to distinguish between loyal and unloyal groups, instead of grouping together
	- becomes a controversial issue among japanese
	- question 27 "Are you willing to serve in the armed forces of the United States on combat duty, wherever ordered?"
		- if you said yes youd be drafted!
	- question 28 along the same lines, "Will you swear unqualified allegiance to the US" "forswear any form of allegiance to the Japanese Emperor or any foreign govt"
		- for issei japanese, very difficult to answer
		- many issei feared they would lose japanese citizenship by answering yes, become stateless
		- for nissei, may also lead to being drafted
	- the title No No Boy comes from the men who answered No and No to these two questions
- Those who "passed" the test were released
	- many japanese who came back from internment had lost all their assets, businesses, and didnt regain them
- 5300 answered "no, no"; 4600 either refused to answer or qualifed their responses
	- qualified such as "yes, yes but on the condition that my family is released from camps"
- "Disloyal" Japanese sent to Tule Lake; Tule Lake becomes a segregation center
- 5589 Japanese-Americans renounce American citizenship
	- may have gotten it back after war
- "Vulgar racism" to "polite racism" (T. Fujitani)
	- "interesting shift in american discourse of race"
	- before review, all japanese considered racism
	- after review, differences within japanese community considered, some japanese allowed to reenter united states if they demonstrate loyalty

##### Japanese American Soldiers
- Of 20,000 men eligible for military service at camps, 315 refused to be drafted and imprisoned
	- "No No Boys"
- About 33,000 Nisei: 100th Infantry Battalion, 442nd Infantry Regiment, and Military Intellignce Service
- *Go for Broke!* (1951)
	- Movie made after the war, about the 442nd Infantry Regiment
	- Nisei Americans seen as loyal by then, and very brace
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRqwLrZKDw0
	- "Go for Broke follows the exploits of the most decorated unit in US Army history - the 442nd Regiment - the first all-Nisei (Japanese-American) combat team in WWII."
	- its giving mash
	- perception of japanese had changed dramatically by this time
	- in this mainstream movie, japanese americans are the heroes

##### John Okada's [[No No Boy]] 1957
- John Okada was Nisei, answered yes yes
- book didnt gain attention until 60s, 70s

##### Questions for the reading
- Why did Ichiro refuse to be drafted? How did that act change his life?
- How does he interact with his family (ie mother, father, and brother)?
- How did his family experience the war?
- How does postwar American society treat him and "no no boys"?
	- and how does the Japanese American community treat them?
- What tensions can we observe in this novel? What are the sources of those tensions?
	- between issei and nissei, between japanese and americans, and more
- How can we consider the historical significances of "no no boys" within the context of American democracy?
	- although nissei were american citizens, they were interned based on national origin
- When the experiences of Japanese Americans vary so much, would it still make sense to talk about the "history of Japanese Americans"?


## [[Unthinking Collaboration - American Nisei in Transwar Japan]]
##### History of the Moment
Unthinking Collaborators and the Way We "Do" History
lecture from Carly Buxton
- Tokyo Rose
- Nisei and WWII
- forced internment
- Tokyo Rose was the name for female radio broadcasters
	- Iva Toguri 
	- graduated UCLA 
	- went to japan in 1941 to care for an aunt
	- common for people to go back and forth between US and Japan
	- eventually hired by radio tokyo
	- becomes radio host for the zero hour
	- after ww2, media wants the story with tokyo rose
	- Iva Toguri says she is tokyo rose, but really theres many
	- she becomes the image of the japanese american traitor
- there were tens of thousands of other japanese americans living in japan during the war
	- many people like toguri, grew up in us, spoke fluent english, probably not much japanese, found themselves in japan during wwii
	- what was it like to live in japan with a us passport?
- collaboration
	- "a dirty word in the history book"
	- treason, traitorous
	- thats not where the story ends
	- why would an individual collaborate with other parties?
- white people interned as well
	- incoming ships after pearl harbor, white people were interned
	- these women went into helping japan in war effort, men were enlisted
- the iceberg of the human mind / History of the Moment
	- why do we look at history through the 5% cognition - what people say, and not look at the 95% - the subconcious, the thoughts, biases
	- all the other factors that influence why a person becomes a traitor - why a person collaborates
- cultural hybridity
	- many issei planned to go back to japan
	- coming from an impoverished background, plan to make their fortune in the us and go back to japan
	- eventually, these families start to stay
	- nisei - the pull between the two sides of their identity
	- weight of becoming upstanding citizens that speak great english but also be connected to japan and speak great japanese
	- push and pull
	- stereotypes and expectations
	- arent at home in either culture, seen as second class citizens, yet seen as a **bridge** between japan and the us
- mary kimoto
	- similar story to tokyo rose
	- worked at a school designed for nisei coming back to japan to study japanese culture and then go back to the us
- "Soft Propaganda"
	- when you think of propaganda, billboards, posters, speeches, etc
	- standardized dress campaign - during war in japan everybody wore a uniform (mostly among men) - psychology of affinity, solidarity
	- style changing - european garb to japanese style
	- baseball - changed all its katakana words to kanji - suppressing western styles etc
- life in wartime japan
	- it was hard!
- internment in japan
	- white americans interned, later sent home
	- subliminal too
- memory
	- many of these individuals have recently passed, Iva Toguri died in 2006
	- many stories have been archived, many people still living today as well
	- Kay Nishimura - Buxton interviewed in 2014
	- Kay was nisei, served japan and stayed thrre - would be easy to tell his story in a negative way - but he has to serve, stranded in japan
- assimilation
	- individual becomes part of the larger society, subduing or giving up ethnic culture
- fusion
	- two cultures combine to produce a new culture
	- nisei oscillated between cultures
- how history spreads
	- people say stuff and that gets passed down
	- common misconception that no japanese were on the ships that brought interned white americans back to the us - Buxton looked at the ship records and found this was not true
	- sources cant be trusted
- Unthinking Collaboration - Learning Guide
	- fun activities and cool stuff publisher wouldnt let her put in the book - on her website

Questions
- they suppresed western culture in japan, the enemy - did they suppress german culture, their ally?
	- complex issue
	- germans thought the same thing of japanese people
- relationships within families for people who stayed in us, people who went to japan
	- not passed down in japan or the us that there were white americans fighting for japan, part of the japanese war effort
	- only been coming out in recent years
	- families were divided
- gender roles
	- patriotic young women, should be ever supportie of the war effort
	- for men, image of the stalwart soldier
- how was it determined who was japanese and who wasnt, etc
	- loyalty was tested
	- on japan side, such a case by case basis, if you looked japanese you were considered japanese
	- mixed people whose ethnicity would be questioned - half japanese, whose fathers were white
	- also had to do with gender
- how do you think of collaboration
	- its not black and white
	- influenced by backstory
	- interested in the word collaboration because "it has been so tortured throughout history", could have done the same with the word loyalty, or treason
- have you looked into the renunciation of marxist beliefs after the war
	- found it so parallel
	- people who were imprisoned and forced to renounce their beliefs
- human agency and free will
	- come into play when you look backward
- consequences after the war
	- if you were conscripted/had no choice probably got your passport back
	- case by case
- now
	- Buxton works as a user experience researcher
	- themes that underlie the work she did help her understand how people feel/think today in her work
- intances that eased the tensions between white americans and japanese at the time
- The Teahouse of the August Moon
- the cover
	- 3 women representing pre war, wartime, post war
