got a 66% on midterm which is actually a B+ bc of curve!

i havent been paying attention hes talking about
oh midterm review
i shouldve paid attention
he did an example about complexity summation stuff with the for loops
def got that wrong

another thing
structural induction
it looks like i did this one right?

the no...no...go...go one
uhhh i dont remember how this one went
theres log involved in the answer so im gonna guess i didnt do it right

and then the combination one with the phone numbers or whatever
think i got this one right


i think he ended with some combinatorics examples from lecture notes but idk
he messed up and just wasnt sharing his screen for the last ten min of class
