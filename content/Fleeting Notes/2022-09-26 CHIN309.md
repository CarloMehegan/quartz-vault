##### the reading
excerpts from the [[Records of the Grand Historian]] by Sima Qian

what to look for
how is history presented? why is it presented in that way?

excerpt from biographies - the section about emperors
first part
![[Pasted image 20220926172954.png]]
it was taboo to say the emperors real name, so he's referred to by multiple names throughout the writings
think about the characterization of Kao-tsu
	not always portrayed in a good way
		major takeaway is that he isnt cruel
	Sima Qian has to be careful what he says to avoid persecution
	trying to present Kao-tsu as someone inevitable
	inevitable to inherit the mandate of heaven because he's so coool

the story
Kao-tsu's kind of a bum but it always works out
he has 20 charisma
he sneaks into some nice banquet and the lord asks him to marry his daughter
a guy says to him"when I examine your face, I find such worth that I cannot express it in words!"
he's getting an origin story
long extensive part about how things start to fall apart, when second emperor of Qin dynasty is taking over
accidentally kills the son of the white emperor who was transformed into a snake or something
	using metaphors
emperor wants to kill Kao-Tsu because the sky says he is inheriting the mandate of heaven i guess
"things start to get reallyl unstable"
the magistrate of p'ei
Kao-Tsu writes on a piece of silk and shoots it over the city walls
![[Pasted image 20220926174923.png]]
they kill the magistrate and make Kao-Tsu the magistrate
now referred further as the Magistrate/Governor of P'ei

skipping ahead
talking about cruel leader Hsiang Yu (Kao-Tsu's main rival for the throne, will become rivals later), saying that governor of P'ei is not cruel

see here how many people, including people of lower stature, see how important Kao-Tsu is

moving on

cruel punishment
	if you do something egregious enough, not only will you be executed, but your whole family
	height of cruelty
	Kao-Tzu waives these laws and establishes new law in the are he rules idk
![[Pasted image 20220926175820.png]]


all this stuff is happening in the central plains, west of yellow sea, modern day Xuzhou or something

Hsiang Yu sets himself up as "Dictator King of Western Chu" and now the rivalry starts

...

war

...

Kao-Tzu is King of Han
people want him to take on role of emperor
declines three times but eventually takes on role as emperor. Han Dynasty is founded

after the story, endnotes
grand historian remarks

wish i could make these embedded pictures smaller

in these remarks we see the idea that the Qin emperors never had the mandate of heaven, thats why they fell

what do you think of this as a justification for rise of a new dynasty?
other peoples answers
- represents him as "hes not perfect but hes better than the other guy"
- "hes not overly cruel" but like yeah he was still cruel
- like when he got drunk and then killed the snake so it was actually good he got drunk
	- becomes a trope in later literature where the hero gets drunk and does something amazing
- showing his divine right, destined from birth
- what do you think about this in relation to other literary sources weve read? how does it represent the world? is this literature?
- what do you make of the narrative style of storytelling?
	- read much closer to a story than a history textbook
	- very narrative prose
	- similar to narrative storytelling of old testament


next week reading book of the han
"other semesters have read this same story but in the book of the han, to see how its documented differently"
