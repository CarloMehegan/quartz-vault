description:: solving problems recursively

Problems solved recursively
lecture 14

How can I break the problem into a number of smaller problems from which I can built it through the given properties? Then, decide when to stop (basis).

Computing $n!$
linear time
```
factorial(n)
	if n=0 return 1
	else return n * factorial(n-1)
```

Computing $a^n$ linear time
linear time
```
power(a, n)
	if n=0 return 1
	else return a*power(a, n-1)
```

Computing $a^n$ in $\log n$ time
log time
Still logarithmic time because the problem size is halved at most every 2 steps
```
power(a, n)
	if n=0 return 1
	else if n is even
		half=power(a, n/2)
		return half*half
	else return a*power(a, n-1)
```

Binary search
uhh didnt talk ab this one that much
log time?
```
Binary_Search(i, j, x)
	if i=j then compare x with a[i] and return T or F
	m = (i+j)/2
	if x = a[m] return T
	else if x<a[m] return Binary_Search(i, m-1, x)
		else return Binary_Search(m+1, j, x)
```

Merge sort
"my favorite sort algorithm by far"
```
Merge_Sort(i, j)
	if i < j
		m = (i+j)/2
		Merge_Sort(i,m)
		Merge_Sort(m+1,j)
		merge the two sorted sublists into one sorted list
```
