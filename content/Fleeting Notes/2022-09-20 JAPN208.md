## [[Fukuzawa's Autobiography]]
##### initial remarks
much more positive than Bird's adventure to Japan
very interesting, gripping detail
he describes political conflicts in japan
easier vocabulary
- translation done not too long ago
- more difficult to read in original japanese
became more outspoken against anti foreign policy

##### presenters
takes a lot of notice of the cultural differences
how wealth is different in san francisco - displayed differently
takes note of large scale of things in europe - big hotels
objective of travel was looking at industry and technological advancement in these countries, he does not focus his notes on that, focuses on culture instead
asks people about how things work
we see his sensibilities arise
- hierarchical structures and power dynamics
	- notices hierarchy not as important in the US ex. george washingtons family
- pride
	- japan doesnt want help
	- he doesnt support japans anti foreign policies but still shows pride himself
he is a contact zone
initiates dictionaries shipped to japan, he picks up new education practices and ideas
fukuzawa highlights internal strife of japan, bird does not talk about politics
- rise of militarism
- anti foreign policy
- power dynamics
- internal warring

comparison to isabella bird's writing
authors are both "pioneers" as first points of contact
difference in why they go
- the allure of going to japan
- vs studying western culture/technology
they both realize how different this new place is
- fukuzawa tries to learn more
- bird does not care to learn more, wants to be accomodated
both are appreciative of how people accomodate them
fukuzawa wants to learn english, bird does not try to learn any japanese
fukuzawa seemed to enjoy the trip more, even though his trip was not for the purpose of enjoyment
both travellers are like moving contact zones, first japanese man/european woman to travel to europe/japan, first contact for many of the people from these countries

japan was just starting to open up to western influence/being forced to open up
fukuzawa doesnt care much for seeing the economic/scientific achievements of the west, because he'd read about them already
he wanted to learn about the culture
he was embarrassed by his lack of cultural knowledge
didnt see a lot of the US, only saw big cities, only accompanied by a govt watcher
didnt see slavery, or any life outside of cities
discouraged by "the foolish pride of japanese people"
wasnt dismissive toward (most) cultural difference, more open minded than bird
several examples of contact zones
tell us a lot about the state of international relations during its time
- western powers were comfortable pushing around smaller countries like japan
- japan was struggling to keep up

##### questions to consider when reading
What did Fukuzawa see in the US and Europe? What did he not see?
	didnt mention much about the environment, nature, when Bird did
	notes high prices, extravagance shown day to day, lack of recycling
	didnt see less developed areas of the US
	**only saw san francisco** (and hawaii)
	demonstrations of power - in europe and us sees big military
	material power and wealth
	was able to get a western perspective on what was going on in japan - when he returned home, he was like a foreigner, he saw the country through new eyes
	doesnt mention asian american communities
	didnt visit any schools/colleges
	doesnt talk about corruption in western govts

How does he observe and evaluate American and European culture?
	curious about culture more than economy/technology
	more positive attitude towards foreign societies
	how would his observations change if he was a single, ordinary traveler like Bird, and not a diplomat? would he have been as negative?
	definite bias
	even still, he was more open to cultural differences
	however he went into the experience already respecting western society from his research
	went in with more respect
	when bird went to japan, it was just one of those exotic barbaric asian countries
	when fukuzawa went to the us, it was the symbol of western civilization
	pro western sentiment
	his experience was limited due to his status as a diplomat
	wanted to find out how capitalism/economic system works
	difference in status between Fukuzawa and Bird is huge
	clean hotel bed vs swampy floor

What sensibilities can we identify in Fukkuzawa's observation?
	idealized the west
	culture shock
	racial differences "thinks white people are pretty"
	differences in wealth
	differences in manners
	started thinking japanese clothing was impractical, started questioning japanese customs
	didnt see any sensibilities towards him - if he was travelling alone, might see more racism, prejudice - maybe he just doesnt write about it

How can we apply the notion of "contact zone" to our reading of this text?
	in unbeaten tracks, Bird was the first European person many Japanese people met
		they followed her around, revered her
	fukuzawa was the first Japanese person a lot of people met
		the same reverence was not present, it was even the inverse; he was reverent of western society, the westerners that met him were not as interested in seeing him as the japanese villagers that followed through town Bird were
	specific instances
		when the british navy are dealing with killing of one of their officials in japan, contact zone
		when he goes to holland, talks to merchants, asks if you are able to sell land freely, if you can build a fortress there, the merchants ask why you would want to do that

Through the reading of Bird and Fukuzawa, what can we tell about international relations (West-Asia relations particularly) in the late 19th century?
	"how can we place bird and fukuzawa's experience within this context"
	strained relationship between Japan and the West
		they needed trade, Japan needed technology, etc
	focus on importance of resources
		trade, tariffs, economic imbalance
	west is strongarming japan
	shogunate's power shrinking
	end of tokugawa era, meiji restoration
		modernization of japan
	more of a solid japanese identity
		nationalism, developing national consciousness
	japan was aware of colonization
		opium wars
		colonization of philippines
		wanted to avoid these fates

##### excerpt from Fukuzawa Yukichi's "Western Civilization as Our Goal"
1870s written after his trips
some quotes

#quote
"Western civilization is an imcomparable means for both strengthening our national polity and increasing prestige of our imperial line. Why, then, do we hesitate to adopt it? We should not even think twice about the matter."
"... in order to preserve national sovereignty the intellectual powers of the people must be elevated."
"... sweeping away blind attachment to past customs and adopting the spirit of Western civilization. ... Once this blind attachment has been stripped away we shall be able to enter the realm of vital intellectual activity."
-Fukuzawa Yukichi

wants to teach the people, wants to adopt western civilization, "sweep away" attachment to old customs

how would you describe Fukuzawa's trips in a phrase?
- A successful American (intellectual) conquest
America was able to turn him over to their side intellectually
