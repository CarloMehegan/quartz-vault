description:: inclusion-exclusion, (generalized) pigeonhole

continuing combinatorics

continuing password example
each password will contain 5 letters and one digit
need to take into account that the digit could be anywhere in the string, and thats important ("7ABCDE" is different from "A7BCDE")


##### Inclusion-exclusion principle
If a task can be done in $n_1$ or $n_2$ ways, but there are $m$ ways of the set of the $n_1$ ways which are also in the set of the $n_2$ ways, then the total number of ways to do the task is $n_1 + n_2 - m$.

basically just subtract the overlapping cases so they arent counted twice

ex. the number of 8-bit strings that start with 1 or end with 00
$1**** * * {*} : 2^7$ such strings
$******00 : 2^6$ such strings
$1 ***** 00: 2^5$ such strings
Total: $2^7 + 2^6 - 2^5$ = 128 + 64 - 32 = 160


##### Pigeonhole principle
If $k$ is a positive integer and $k+1$ or more objects are placed into $k$ boxes, then there is at least one box containing two or more objects.

aka 2 boxes and 3 blocks, one box will have more than one block always

he goes over proof for this but i dont wanna write

ex. In a group of 367 people, there are at least two people with the same birthday.

##### Generalized pigeonhole principle
If $N$ objects are placed into $k$ boxes, then there is at least one box containing at least $[N/k]$ boxes.

ex. among 100 people, there are at least $[100/12] = 9$ who were born in the same month
note that it rounds up
