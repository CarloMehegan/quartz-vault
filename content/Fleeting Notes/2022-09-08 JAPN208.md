Many western travelers went to Japan during the Meiji era (1868 - 1912)
What political and economic factors enabled and ecouraged this movement?
How did they experience Japan?

Isabella Bird, Unbeaten Tracks in Japan, 1880
Bird traveled in Japan in 1878; what was going on in Japan circa 1878?

The Meiji Restoration
- society was changing dramatically
- name refers to emperor Meiji, ruled from (1868 - 1912)
- Meiji Restoration - a series of reforms implemented by the new government in Tokyo
- before Meiji, japan was ruled by Shogun from the Tokugawa family in Edo (1603 - 1867)
	- more than 200 domains, each of which ruled by Daimyo
	- power of Shogun was limited
		- shogun was head of samurai
		- shogun for a long time had political power, and emperor was a symbol of japan (like prime minister and the queen (RIP!))
	- emperor in Kyoto had no political power
	- -> power of central govt was very limited
	- geographical and social mobility both very limited
- Meiji era was an attempt to construct a strong central government
- Western imperialism in 19th century / 1800s -> need for modern centralized state
- Tokugawa govt (Shogun govt) overthrown by alliance of anti-Tokugawa domains
- domains worried that japan would be very weak if they didnt unify the domains
- shogun tokugawa yoshinobu, the last tokugawa shogun 15th shogun, returns sovereignty to emperor in **1867**, end of shogun era

Treaty Ports
- Treaty of Amity and Commerce
	- between US and Japan **1858**
	- signed by 14th shogun
	- "open the country. we have ships with guns. gun ships"
- Similar treaties with Britain, France, Russia, Netherlands
- Five ports open for trade
	- Yokohama, Kobe, Hakodate, Nagasaki, Niigata
	- spread throughout the country
	- **foreigners allowed to live in these cities**
	- **extraterritorial rights for foreigners**
- No tariff autonomy for Japan
	- trade taxes
	- japanese govt didnt have the power to determine tax rate
	- tariffs were decided by the importing countries
	- tax rates were very low
- chinese merchants not allowed to live in foreign settlements until after Meiji restoration
- foreign settlements abolished in 20th century
	- still see many buildings today from these settlements with architecture influenced from foreign countries staying there
- the foreigners coming through were very rich, merchants

Westerners in Japan
- Diplomats, merchants, their families
	- Rich!
- Foreign advisors for public and private sectors in early Meiji era
	- *oyatoi* - those hired - refers to these foreign advisors
	- provided knowledge and skills necessary for modernization
	- military, education, medicine, transportation, architecture, law, diplomacy, fine arts, etc.
	- Hokkaido national university - created during this time by foreign advisors
- Tourist industry flourished, targeting Westerners
	- John Murray - famous writer published travel guides

Unbeaten Tracks
- Historical contextualization necessary for this reading
	- be able to place the significance of her writing with historical context of late 1800s
- Contexts
	- Global - british imperialism in asia, global capitalism/opening of japan for trade
	- Technological - steamship
	- Economic - gap between Western countries and Japan, Japan was very affordable to travel to
	- Cultural - John Murray's *Handbook for Travelers* series started 1836
	- Personal - acquainted with Colin Alexander McVean; an engineer who worked as *oyatoi*
	- Domestic (Japan) - unification of Japan, opening of ports, mobility within the country improving
- when you read, feels like a very personal account, but read deeper and incorporate these contexts into your reading
- Questions
	- Why did she become interested in Japan?
	- As a primary document, what calues and significances does Bird's book have?
	- During her travel, what about Japan did she pay attention to?
	- What relations did she build with people in Japan?
	- "European sensibilities" ? "British sensibilities" ?
	- We talked about [[Imperial Eyes#contact zone|contact zone]] and [[Imperial Eyes#anti-conquest|anti-conquest]] last class. Can we apply these concepts?
