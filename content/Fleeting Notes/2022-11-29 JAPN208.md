##### [[Child of Okinawa]]
initial thoughts
- good at emulating the voice of a young person
- interesting how Tsune thinks logically about some points and illogically about others
- even though author was an adult he wrote the novella very well in a childish manner
- okinawa from a childs perspective
- tsuneyoshi is like 12 years old either elem or middle school

presenters
- 1
	- "pretty mundane story" nothing extraordinary happens
	- just follows tsuneyoshis life
	- important themes throughout
		- conflict with parents
		- military occupation
		- adolescence
		- sexual themes
	- he feels like a burden to his family
	- abuse from parents
	- feels like a burden and resents family at the same time
	- very negative feelings toward occupation
		- soldier throwing a grenade into a bar
		- parents have to sell women
		- grandparents farm paved over
	- how occupation affects woman specifically
		- in [[The Only Woman in the Room]] story about empowering women
		- here, the opposite
	- highlights how occupation hurts those occupied
- 2
	- growing anti us sentiment
	- use of tsuneyoshi as a child magnifies the effects of the occupation, doesnt understand why these things have to happen
	- taxi driver
		- displayed soldiers' blatant disregard for law and safety
		- "theyve taken it too far this time"
		- didnt even pay the cab driver their fare
- 3
	- in particular the ways it expresses the impacts bases and soldiers had on every day life
	- home no longer fully feels like home / home is being taken away
		- seen in tsuneyoshis privacy not respected
	- reminisces about life before the war in the village tsune used to live in
	- correlates feelings of loss with increased presence of soldiers
	- yearns to escape and live on an island
	- strained relationships
		- between soldiers and okinawans
		- taxi driver and soldiers
		- tsune and family members
	- "this town where everyone's life is filled with misery, this town where women are sold night and day"
	- expresses a much darker and dismal image of how life has become
	- storm at the end signifies how hard it is to escape, symbolic of the occupation
	- the ship probably wouldve sunk and tsune died after the end
	- mineos view of okinawa is that its already sunken

Issues to consider
- narratives of american presnece
- relations between the japanese and the americans; and among the japanese
- images of okinawa that the novel creates
- comparison to the previous readings

difference from other two readings
- other two focused on mainland japan
- okinawa was colonized by the us
- different levels of occupation
- japan rebuilt after the war and became a big economy, but okinawa was left to remain poor and ravaged
- difference in perspective; this story is from the other side of the war
- sirota gordon was more an observer, tsune is living in it, suffering
similarities
- tensions between japan and us
what if a japanese person talked about the same thing sirota gordon talked about? would the narrative change?
- would be very different, more bleak
- other side of the war
what if an american person talked about the same thing mineo talked about? would the narrative change?
- probably more similar to gordon, just observing whats happening
- watered down
perspective is very important in framing the actual events
narrative depends on the narrator

tsuneyoshi being a kid
- tsunes perspective as a kid magnifies the effect of occupation
- makes the story so much more horrifying seeing what the kid is exposed to
- can empathize more with this character
- because hes a child wandering around the city, we see more of okinawa than otherwise, different perspectives

relation between okinawans and americans, okinawans and okinawans
- okinawans are being treated poorly, in financial crisis
- businesses are there because they need to capitalize on money coming in from soldiers passing through the city
- colonial relationship
- okinawan economy depends on american forces
- novel describes how okinawa was built around the military highway; this place shouldnt even exist
- class separation
- dont have a choice, need to run businesses catering to americans in order to put food on the table
- sex industry in okinawa
	- happens in many other places with military bases
	- similar economic structures
	- divide between gender, how women are treated
	- women are the people bringing in money
- in the novel, prostitutes are presented pretty much as normal workers
	- from tsunes perspective, part of every day mundane life
- relation between american soldiers and japanese prostitutes
	- inequality in gender, and race, and class

images of okinawa
- rundown, dirty
	- nature aspects have been ruined, overflowing with sewage, tsunes living conditions are dirty
	- tsune uses the beach, being out in nature as an escape from the city
	- nature contrasts with urban environments
- "today in japanese imagination, okinawa is mostly a tourist destination, uncontaminated"
	- okinawa today is by far the poorest prefecture in japan
	- still viewed as a nice tourist destination
- tainted
	- describes nice landscapes, and then an american outpost in the middle
	- beautiful wharf lined with american yachts
	- nature as a juxtaposition for innocence, areas that are still untouched

comparison to two previous readings
- difference in audience
- in beyond vietnam see how japan is separated, other asian nations are underdeveloped and japan is more well off; this reading shows that isnt so true
- reischauer talks about improving countries that the us is trying to democratize, okinawa is outside of that scope
- reischauer mainly talking about european colonialism, not american colonialism
- sees colonialism as something thats already over

how would you describe the reading in a few words
- perverted
- tainted
- explotation
