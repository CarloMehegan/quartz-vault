description:: implication, binary operators

last time
compound propositions + operators + truth tables
"not like functions you used in calculus"
- calculus - defined by a formula
- here it is a finite, discrete set
- defined with truth tables
propositions can be written in different ways with different combinations of operators

left off at implication
- water pipe analogy
	- if water comes in, water comes out = good/true
	- if water comes in, water does not come out = bad/false
	- water does not come in, water comes out = ? could be outside factors, doesnt mean its bad/false, so its still good/true, because "if p is true then q" if q is true does not necessarily mean p is true
	- water does not come in, water does not come out = good/true

equivalence $p \leftrightarrow q$
- if p and q are the same, then true
$p \leftrightarrow q \equiv (p \rightarrow q) \bigwedge (q \rightarrow p)$

ferrari example
p = car is a ferrari, q = car is red
$p \rightarrow q$ means if a car is a ferrari, then the car must be red

not q implies not p
$\neg q \rightarrow \neg p \equiv p \rightarrow q$
contradiction / contrapositive

how do we prove this formula in general?
use truth tables, show that tables are equivalent

back to ferrari example
$\neg q \rightarrow \neg p$ means if the car is not red, then it mustnt be a ferrari
$\neg p \bigvee q$ means car is not a ferrari or car is red

synonyms for implication
if p then q
p implies q
q follows from p
**q whenever p**
- can have q without p, but if p is true then q must be true


$p \leftrightarrow q$
- p and q are equivalent
- p is necessary and sufficient for q
- p if and only if q aka p iff q
ex. a car is a ferrari if and only if it is red
- this is false, because there are other colors of ferraris


these operators that take two variables only have 4 options
how many total operators can there be with these two variables?
call an operator $\oint$ for example

how many $\oint$ 's can be made with one variable?
1. $\neg$
2. identity $I(p)$
3. a function that makes all options true
4. a function that makes all options false
there are two possible options for one variable, T and F
these are the 4 combos of T and F that can be made
$2^{options} = possible functions$

so for two variables, there are 4 options/combinations
$2^4 = 16$
weve seen
1. and
2. or 
3. xor
4. implication
5. equivalent
there are 11 more

with 3 variable?
$2^3 = 8$ options
$2^{2^3} = 2^8 = 256$ functions

with n variables, $2^{2^n}$ functions
