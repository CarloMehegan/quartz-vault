- American occupation starts, 1945-1952
- Douglas MacArthur: Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers

	- in okinawa, us ruled directly by establishing govt there
	- american occupation of korea was similar to occupation of okinawa
- Emperor's divinity rejected
	- until end of war japanese ppl were told emperor was a divine being
	- created sense of unity of empire
	- american occupation, especially MacArthur, rejected this idea of divine being
	- famous picture of Macarthur with Emperor Hirohito
	- ![[Pasted image 20221101142146.png]]
	- just a dude
	- height makes hirohito look diminutive
	- MacArthur wanted this picture published to show people he was just a dude

	- "I dont think people before this really believed the emperor was divine, but american occupation confirmed this"
- Women granted voting right, 1945

	- about 100 class A war criminals arrested - top figures in the military, etc
	- about 15 sentenced to death/executed

	- Fundamental human rights
	- Gender equality
		- fought for by Beate Sirota Gordon
- Land reform, 1947
	- one of the most fundamental reforms americans implemented
	- america bought land from landlords very cheaply
	- sold that land to peasants very cheaply
	- purpose to create independent farmers instead of tenant farmers
		- tenant farmers would work on a landlords land and pay the landlord rent
		- landlords wouldnt have to work just collect rent

- presented as if the people wrote this constitution (but yknow, written by americans)
- article 1
	- "The Emperor shall be the symbol of the State and of the unity of the People, deriving his position from the will of the people with whom resides sovereign power."
- article 4
	- "he shall nor have powers related to the government"
- emperor is just a symbol, with no poliitcal power

	- house of reps and peers are part of the imperial diet
	- reps were popularly elected, peers were not
- Constitution of Japan becomes effective, May 1947; House of Peers replaced by House of Councilors

##### The Only Woman in the Room
discussion questions
- Who is Sirota Gordon? How does she identify herself?
- How does she narrate her cross-border movement? 
	- What categories does she use? ("As a woman, as a foreigner, as a white woman, etc")
- What advantages (or privileges) and disadvantages does she experience in japan during American occupation?
- How does she view Japanese society and Japanese women?
	- in previous classes students said she is condescending, similar to Bird in [[Unbeaten Tracks In Japan]]
	- "I want you to be nice with her"
	- think about her experience in 1940s 1950s as a woman
- Conservatives in Japan insist that the Japanese constitution was "imposed" by the Americans against the will of the Japanese. Does Sirota Gordon's narrative reinforce this discourse or challenge it?
