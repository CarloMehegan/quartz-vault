description:: talking about [[Book of Han]]

last time talked about records of the grand historian
now talking about similar records of history
talked about the annals of Kao-Tsu last time

for reflection feel free to compare and contrast readings, make connections, do a deep dive on one reading, "intentionally flexible"

##### Official Histories
General bibliographic classification
Histories vetted by imperial authorities
or
The 24 dynastic histories
from book of the han all the way through 20th century

very powerful, important thing to make
made by highly skilled scholars, used archives
compiled for the last dynasty by the new dynasty
shows they have the power as a new dynasty to compile these texts

patterns in how these official histories are written
- chronological parts
- biographies
- unique structure

unofficial histories tend to be more scattered


today talking about

[[Book of Han]]
or, Book of the Former Han
describes the first part of the dynasty
later book talks about second half
split in two halves because from 9-23 AD overthrown (Xin dynasty)
Former/Western Han and Latter/Eastern Han
named because of the location of their capitals (~400km apart)

modeled after the style of the records of the grand historian
only discusses events of the han dynasty, doesnt describe what came before

Ban Gu (32-92) conceived of as a continuation of the records of the grand historian
died in jail, buddies with someone suspected of plotting a rebellion

Ban Zhao (29-120) finished the Book of the Han, very famous female writer

Treatise on Literature
trying to give an organizing principle for knowledge
- Confucian Classics
	- texts Confucius regarded as core of his teaching
- Book of Philosophers
	- Daoist texts, etc
- Poetry
- Military Works
- Astonomy/Astrology/Math
- Medicine
the basic categories Ban Gu used to sort all literature

##### first reading, The Passing of Kung Sheng
one of the biographies that appears in the book of the han
tells us about the death of this figure Kung Sheng
to think about when reading these texts - why is this included in this text? why is this biography important for us to know about?

Kung Sheng and Ping Han's reactions to the fall of the Former Han dynasty
for the dynasty to fall, elites need to buy in to the new dynasty
this is a story about Kung Sheng remaining loyal to the old dynasty
offered a sweet retirement/tenure deal
Kung Sheng doesnt want to work for Wang Mang (guy that usurped)
Wang Mang sends people out to try to get Kung Sheng to return, he wants his help
Kung Sheng skips the audience says he's sick
"common trope we see"
Two years later, sends important people ("showing how both Wang Mang and Kung Sheng have power")
says hes sick
says hes gonna die soon anyways he wont survive the journey to the capital
"this move is something a lot of people will later emulate"
Kung Sheng realizes they won't leave him alone as long as he's alive
"How could I with my single life serve two ruling houses, and face my former rulers below?"
"This attitude is enormously respected throughout history"
Kung Sheng says he should have a very humble funeral
"When he had finished speaking, he did not again open his mouth to drink or eat. When fourteen days had passed he died' he was seventy-eight years old at death"
theres a part about his funeral
theres an elderly mourner who wails loudly, makes a quote, leaves
	is this the historian inserting themself, editorializing
	probably

what do you make of the narrative style of this? how does it differ from last reading?
	no fantastical elements
	less narrative, more factual
	also structurally very different stories, this one isnt about an emperor


##### Annals of Gao Zu (Kao-Tsu)
story we read last time about Kao-Tsu also documented in this writing
explains more about how Kao Tsu transitioned from the charisma 20 dude to the wise Confucian emperor man


##### Records of the Three Kingdoms
by Chen Shou (233-297)

not really chronologically organized
expanded later by another dude

Romance of the Three Kingdoms, one of the most famous Chinese novels, based on the records

##### second reading, Biography of Hua T'o
from the Records of the Three Kingdoms

Hua T'o
- a famous physician
- physicians at this time typically seen as not smart enough to become higher doctors, snake oil salesmen
- seen as extremely intelligent
- interested in medicine, turns down employment in the govt
- one thing emphasized in the bio is his minimalism
	- "the decoctions he prepared required only a few ingredients"
	- someone said "reminds me of Dao story about the butcher"
	- butcher that knew exactly where to cut
- minimally invasive in how he treats people
- text delves into different episodes of his ability to diagnose/treat people
- shows the sort of medical problems/concerns people had at the time
- when Hua T'o is unable to treat people, he is at least precise in knowing what the problem is
- variety of ailments he cures
- cases where people dont take his advice and die
- he can spot illness just looking at people
- pretty weird stuff but shows us how people understood these things to work
	- balancing cold and heat
	- essence
- treats the king of Wei, Ts'ao Ts'ao aka T'ai Tsu, protagonist of the romance of the three kingdoms
- later when Ts'ao Ts'ao's condition gets worse, Hua T'o is summoned to care for him personally, requests to go back home to visit family with the excuse his wife is sick, decides he doesnt want to go back, Ts'ao Ts'ao eventually finds out his wife was not sick, Ts'ao Ts'ao has him executed
	- Ts'ao Ts'ao on Hua T'o's skill: "Do you think there arent any other rats like him under heaven?"
	- shows there isnt respect for physicians
- Hua T'o knows he'll be executed, writes all of his knowledge down, head of prison burns it in fear of getting in trouble
- later Ts'ao Ts'ao's son becomes sick, laments what he did to Hua T'o, wishes he could treat his son
- biography keep going from here, not chronological, keeps giving more anecdotes of him helping people

takeaways from this reading
- kind of like medical tv shows
- minimalism/daoism idea
- shows us what ailments/health concerns people had back then
- not meant to give a comprehensive detail of this person's life, but give anecdotes that exemplify his life
- "I see the roots of fiction growing here"
- "implies that because great people exists, times were good, and the dynasty was good because it produced these people"



moving on from here
start talking about

next reading Tao Yuanming and Xie Lingyun
origins of landscape poetry in china
both poets/writers

essays due friday
