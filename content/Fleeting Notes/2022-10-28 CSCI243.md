description:: time complexity analysis

binary search time complexity analysis
every step we throw out half of the elements we are searching in
step 1 after a constant number of operations there remain $\frac n 2$ elements.
step 2 after another constant number of operations there remain $\frac n 2 / 2$ elements aka $\frac n {2^2}$
after step 3, $\frac n {2^3}$ elements remain
so after k steps $\frac n {2^k}$ elements
we stop when search = 1 = $\frac n {2^k}$
$2^k = n \leftrightarrow k = log_2n$
$O(logn)$ time
nice

this is crazy efficient
ex $10^9$ elements, will be searched in $9log10$ steps = ~27 steps!
wow
neat

Complexity of algorithms
The computational complexity of an algorithm includes time complexity and space complexity. Unless otherwise stated, we focus on time complexity of algorithms. The time complexity of an algorithm is defined as the number of basic steps the algorithm goes through from input to output.
It is usally represented as a function $T(n)$ of the size of input $n$ and simplified by $O$ and $\Theta$, which emphasizes the asymptotic performance of algorithms for large input sizes and makes it easy to compare complexity of different algorithms.

Worst case
We usually examine **worst-case** complexity. Average case complexity is also popular (involving probability and averaging over all inputs)

Defintions
$I_n$ any instance of size $n$.
$t(I_n)$ time spent on $I_n$ by the algorithm
$T(n)$ worst-case time complexity of any instance of size n
	$T(n) = max_{\forall I_n} \{t(I_n)\}$
$A(n)$ average-case time complexity over all possible instance
	$A(n) = \mathbb{E} (t(I_n))$
	the expectation value of $t(I_n)$

analysis _ ?
uhh idk he did something idk i wasnt paying attention he was explaining an analysis thing or talking about search again 

lower bound analysis
seeks to find a lower bound function $f(n)$ such that any algorithm for solving a particular problem cannot have worst case time less than $f(n)$
or in other words $T(n) = \Omega(f(n))$ for any algorithm solving this problem
