## The Wheel of Time
##### About
[The Wheel of Time](The%20Wheel%20of%20Time.md) is a high fantasy book series written by Robert Jordan and completed by Brandon Sanderson after Jordan's passing. The series is well-known for its influence on present-day Western fantasy works, and is praised for its intricate worldbuilding and well-developed characters. The first book was released in 1990 and the final book in 2013.

##### Notes
Unlike other works in this project, the Wheel of Time is not a Chinese fantasy work. However, influence from Eastern philosophies and Chinese fantasy is present in the series. The wheel itself represents a cycle of death and rebirth, with ages rising and falling over and over agian. This idea can parallel the views of beginnings and endings in Buddhism and Daoism. These parts of The Wheel of Time's worldbuilding show an influence from Eastern works, if not necessarily wuxia works. Many stories that were inspired by The Wheel of Time, such as Brandon Sanderson's next series [Stormlight Archives](Stormlight%20Archives.md) or Will Wight's [Cradle](Cradle.md), show an even heavier influence from Chinese fantasy works.
