## Legends of The Condor Heroes
##### Synopsis
[Legends of the Condor Heroes](Legends%20of%20the%20Condor%20Heroes.md) is a wuxia novel written by Jin Yong, pen name for the late Louis Cha. The novel follows the adventures of two young men, Guo Jing and Yang Kang, who become sworn brothers and embark on a series of dangerous quests. The novel is set in the Song Dynasty, and the story revolves around the conflict between the Song Empire and the invading Jurchen Jin Dynasty.

##### English Publication
The novel was published for the first time in English across 4 volumes starting in 2018. The translation was done by Anna Holmwood.

"Considering that he has sold in the hundreds of millions and his reputation extends over most of East Asia, it is astonishing that it has taken sixty years to get here. Why, may you ask? Many have considered Jin Yongâ€™s world too foreign, too Chinese, for an English-speaking readership. Impossible to translate."  
\- *Anna Holmwood in the Prologue of Volume 1:* A Hero Born

##### Notes
The republication of this work in English shows the increased interest in Chinese fantasy among Western audiences, not only for new works, but older ones too. I find this work similar to [The Wheel of Time](The%20Wheel%20of%20Time.md) as a precursor to fantasy works written today.
