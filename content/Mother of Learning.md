## Mother of Learning
##### About
[Mother of Learning](Mother%20of%20Learning.md) is a [Xianxia](Xianxia.md) series published serially first on [Fictionpress](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning) and then on [RoyalRoad](https://www.royalroad.com/home) starting in 2011, written by Domagoj Kurmaic. The story follows a student of a magical academy who gets stuck in a time loop. In order to escape, he has to hone his power and learn more about the world and the forces that trapped him.

##### Notes
[Mother of Learning](Mother%20of%20Learning.md) is one of the most, if not the most successful of the thousands of digitally published xianxia stories available online. One interesting thing about this story is that it was not written by a Chinese writer and translated to Englishâ€”it was written by a Croatian writer. This shows how widespread the [Xianxia](Xianxia.md) community was by the time Kurmaic had started writing the series.

The series became successful enough that in 2022, a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wraithmarked/motheroflearningarc1/description) was created to print the series, a rarity for xianxia works like this one. The goal of $10,000 was reached in 67 minutes, and the total amount sits at $126,176 as of December 15, 2022. This huge funding success shows the enormous community around xianxia and [Progression Fantasy](Progression%20Fantasy.md) works. This community continues to grow as Kurmaic plans a [second](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wraithmarked/mother-of-learning-arc-2) Kickstarter to publish the next arc of the story.
