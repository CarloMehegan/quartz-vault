## Sufficiently Advanced Magic
##### About
[Sufficiently Advanced Magic](Sufficiently%20Advanced%20Magic.md) is a [Progression Fantasy](Progression%20Fantasy.md) series with [LitRPG](LitRPG.md) elements written by Andrew Rowe. The story follows a boy named Corin Cadence attempting to reach the top floor of a tower filled with traps and magic, fighting in order to find out what happened to his brother, who entered years ago. The series' magic system takes influence from [Xianxia](Xianxia.md), shonen anime, and role-playing games, with characters gaining discrete levels of supernatural power.

##### Notes
Before becoming an author, Andrew Rowe was a video game developer for companies like Blizzard and Obsidian. His background in video games shows in this series, which has many worldbuilding elements similar to RPG worlds. Sufficiently Advanced Magic isn't exactly a litRPG novel, as the characters don't interact with user interfaces or follow other litRPG tropes, but video game influence is still a large part of the work.

The power progression in the series takes inspiration from [Xianxia](Xianxia.md) stories, similar to [Cradle](Cradle.md). The authors of these two series, Will Wight and Rowe, were among the authors who [first coined the term](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgressionFantasy/comments/auscvg/what_is_progression_fantasy/) progression fantasy to describe their works.
