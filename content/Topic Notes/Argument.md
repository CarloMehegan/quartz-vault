## Argument
An argument is a sequence of statements that ends with a conclusion.
If the **premises** (preceding statements) are true, then the **conclusion** (final statement) must be true. This is a **valid** argument.

Typically, an argument is a sequence of [[Proposition|Propositions]].

**Argument form** is the notation that replaces the argument with a sequence of compound propositions and/or [[Predicate|Predicates]]. The argument can also be presented in argument form using propositional variables to represent the propositions.
Argument form is the simplified version of the argument

##### Argument Form Notation

using propositional variables, argument form may look like this:

representing a generalized form of the argument

##### Proving an Argument is Valid
Example:
"If you have a correct password, you can log onto the network."
"You have a current password."
Therefore,
"You can log onto the network."

Written in proper notation, with $p$ = you have a correct password and $q$ = you can log onto the network:

How do we prove this example is true/this argument is valid?
...
There are logical ways to prove that the argument is valid, but let's just skip to the laws we can use to streamline these justifications. We could always use truth tables to show that an argument form is valid, or we could use laws consisting of simple argument forms and combine them to validate argument forms.

These laws/rules are called [[Rules of Inference]].
