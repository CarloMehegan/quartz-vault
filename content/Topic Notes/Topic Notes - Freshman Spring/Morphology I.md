# Morphology I
### Morphology
How are words made?
Do speakers know how to add modifiers to words, or do they add them on the spot?
60,000 word roots / parts of words
Model how mental grammar works through the parts of words

##### concatenative
"parts being put together in a room"
"toy trains"
Sticking parts of words together

ex. English help-ful-ness
- individual elements
- some elements can stand by themselves
- must be in the correct order
ex. Aztec $[i-kali-mes]$
- dashes show parts

Focusing, in this class, on concatenative morphology

##### non-concatentative
aka interweaving

ex. English sit vs. sat
- not adding parts of words, changing the word
- a different vowel is "interwoven"



### Morphemes
aka parts of words aka "morphs"
The smallest, meaningful part of a word
Can have multiple in a word, or just one

ex. English help-ful-ness
- help, ful, ness are morphs
- "p" or "ss" is meaningless, these parts are just smaller parts of another morph

ex. English [kæt] 'cat'
- one morph
ex. English [kæt-s] 'cats'
- two morphs

##### lexical morphemes
ex. English "book" "red" "love"
Lexical morphs are meaningful even on their own

##### functional morphemes
ex. English "the" "for" "with"
Used around lexical morphemes to convey more meaning
On their own, not as meaningul

Real distinction between functional and lexical morphs in speakers' minds
Kids develop use of lexical morphs before functional morphs



### Bound and Free Morphemes
##### free
ex. English "book" "red" "love" "the" "for" "with"
Can be said without other morphs attached to them
Other morphs can be added to change the meaning, but these morphs can stand alone

##### bound
ex. English "-s" "-ed"
Cannot stand alone, used to modify other morphs

Not the same difference between free and bound as lexical and functional
In some languages the distinction is the same, but not always
ex. English "for" is free, but also functional
ex. English "book" is free, and also lexical



### Affixes
All affixes are bound morphs
Affixes get added onto a more meaningful part of the word

##### root
The most meaningful part of a concatenative word
Affixes are added to roots
ex. English "help-ful"
- "help" is the root which "ful" is an affix of

##### stem
Whatever a particular affix attaches to
Some stems are also part of a root

ex. English "help-ful-ness"
- "help-ful" is the stem which "ness" is an affix of


### Types of Affixes
##### prefix
before the word
"dis-like"

##### suffix
after the word
"like-s"

##### circumfix
need to add a suffix and prefix to a word, just the suffix or just the prefix are not a word necessarily

ex. Indonesian "ke-bebas-an"
- "bebas" means free

##### infix
add a affix into the middle of a word

bad ex. English "abso-fricking-lutely"
- infixing "fricking" 
- see workshop 1

ex. Indonesian "pa-la-tuk"
- "patuk" means peck
- "palatuk" means a woodpecker
- adding "la" into the middle of the word


### Inflectional and Derivational Affixes
##### inflectional affixes
Change the form of the word in some way, but do not profoundly change the word itself

ex. English "cat" vs. "cat-s"
- Singular vs. plural cats
- Changes the word but still talking about cat

##### derivational affixes
ex. English "review"
- as in a movie review
- a critic's review is not the same as a literal "re-view," or viewing something again
- the meaning has moved away from the literal meaning of the word and its affixes

ex. English "dislike"
- changes the meaning, has nothing to do with liking something

derivational affixes give us new words with their own meanings
can change part of speech (doesn't have to)

##### differences
"inflectional affixes are usually added on the spot, derivational affixes happen over time"

some ambiguity
ex "walk" vs. "walked"
- inflectional or derivative?
- can look at common categories of inflectional affixes

##### common types of inflectional affixes
- marking a plural, changing numbers
- first vs. second vs. third-person, etc.
- gendered terms "waiter" vs. "waitress"
- possessives
- tense "walk" vs. "walked"
- voice and mood
- cases on nouns (seen in old English)
- respect markers
- comparative/superlative markers "blue," "bluer," "bluest"

### Intangibles (to be rewritten)
- Morphological analysis sheet we did, done on paper
- "affixes are usually productive"
- "some are not as productive as others"
- "inflectional are usually very productive"
- "derivational are a little less productive / a little less transparent"
