### Ambiguity
Languages are complex and there is ambiguity in all languages

##### Structural Ambiguity
"I happen to live down the street from a French history professor"
ambiguous whether the professor teaches French or is French

"I once shot an elephant in my pajamas," 
"how the elephant got in my pajamas I don't know"

If a sentence is ambiguous, we need multiple trees, one for each possibility that the reader may have in mind

Example written on handout
"the woman hit the man with the umbrella"
Two trees, one if the woman has the umbrella and one if the man has the umbrella


### Conjunction (abbreviated CONJ)
ex. "and"
joins two phrases (of the same type) together
rule
- let x represent any phrase
- XP -> XP CONJ XP


### Final Phrase Structure Rules
NP -> (Det) (Adj) N (PP)
PP -> P NP
VP -> (ADV) V (NP) (ADV) (PP) (ADV)
S   -> NP VP
XP -> XP CONJ XP
