# Meaning I
How language users interface with the language
How language structure produces meaning
How peoples social interpretations cause meaning

### Study of Meaning
##### semantics
meaning on its own

##### pragmatics
meaning in context

##### example
"I think we should invite Bill"
could look at the meaning of this sentence
could figure out its meaning semantically

could also look at this sentence in context
as an answer to "who should we invite - Bill and Mary?"

has its own meaning on its own, but with context in pragmatics it has different meanings

pragmatic meaning
"who should we invite - Bill and Mary?"
"I think we should invite Bill"
meaning - Mary is not invited



### Semantics
##### Usage-based definitions
using a word to convey a particular meaning

"language is a grammar and a lexicon" from the start of the semester
- the lexicon has in it words with their meaning and their relationships with each other

different from a dictionary, prescriptive definition

words have particular meanings for different people
- inside jokes
- slang
- terms within a community

usage-based dictionaries
- OED Oxford English Dictionary tries
- Urban Dict

"Dictionaries are just the depositories for words already legitimized by usage" Thomas Jefferson

how do we get usage based definitions?
- "cool"
- first meant cold
- started to mean someone emotionally distant, etc
- early 20th century rose in slang particularly related to African American communities, jazz
- still used
- defies usual "cycles" of slang and hasn't died out yet
most slang comes and goes


##### Semantic Roles
looking at meaning, not looking at grammar roles necessarily
there are many semantic roles but we will look at four

ex. agent
- when you have the doer of the action
- we used subject as the doer in workshop
- "Magistra kicked the can"
- really the agent is always the doer
- there are sentences where the agent is not the subject
- "The can was kicked by Magistra"
- *semantics helps us make sense of ideas like active vs passive sentences seen here
- the agent is the subject in active sentences

ex. patient
- the do-ee of the action
- the object, in active sentences

some languages mark agent and patient grammatically, not the subject and object
morphology that represents the meaning

ex. instrument
- what is used to do an action

ex. locative
- where the action is happening


##### Truth Conditions
seen in math, philosophy
has lots of notation
we're not gonna use the notation

a way of expressing meaning abstractly

"if you know what a sentence means, you can express the conditions under which that sentence is true"

don't need to have a true sentence to have meaning false sentences can have meaning

if you can express what would make that sentence true, then you have delved into the complete meaning of that sentence

ex. "George Washington was the first president"
- there needs to be a person named George Washington
- there needs to be an office position called the president
- George Washington has to be the first one to hold the position
- there isn't anyone else that came before him
- if he is the first, that probably means there have been more since his presidency
- "the" first means there weren't other presidents at the same time

ex. "I bought apples and oranges"
- order of which you bought first doesn't matter
ex. "I got pregnant and had a child" vs. "I had a child and got pregnant"
- order matters, changes meaning
does and imply an order? idk maybe sometimes whatevs

ex. "George Washington was a unicorn"
- there is a person named George Washington
- there are things called unicorns
	- could be an animal, or like a member of a secret society like Freemasons, etc

Truth values - true or false
T "George Washington was the first president"
F "George Washington was a unicorn"



### Ambiguity
having two or more meanings

##### lexical ambiguity
when the word itself has two or more meanings

ex. chair
- sitting in a chair
- is it the furniture or holding a position
- chair can be a verb too, to chair
- could mean a wheelchair

furniture N
person N
action V
wheelchair N
probably more

might be ambiguous to a listener what meaning is used
unambiguous to the speaker

##### structural ambiguity
because of the way the words are arranged in a sentence


##### scope
sentence has some sort of quantifier term
ex. a number, "few", "only"

happens when you have a quantifier in a sentence and it could apply to more than one thing in a sentence

ex. "they only want to throw a pillow at him"
- "only" could refer to the only thing that happens to "him"
- "only" could refer to the "only person" they want to throw a pillow at is "him"
- "only" could refer to them only "wanting" to throw a pillow
- etc.
- "only" could refer to almost any other part of this sentence
- could take scope over anything
- how words are emphasized can help disambiguate

- first few headers are disorganized could use some revision later with better definitions for terms
