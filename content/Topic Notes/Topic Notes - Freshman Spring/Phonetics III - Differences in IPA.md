# Phonetics III
Focusing on differences between American English chart and International Phonetic Alphabet chart

see chart:
### [[International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)]]

### Consonants 
- Pulmonic = lungs, sounds made with air
- Non-pulmonic = no air
- White spaces = sounds that are possible to make, but not used by any studies languages
- Grey spaces = sounds deemed impossible to make

##### Newly-introduced places of articulation
Retroflex
	- "druh"
	- move tip of tongue back and make a "duh" sound
- Uvular
	- further back than velar
	- "guh," but farther back
- Pharyngeal
	- back in throat
	- voiced fricative "thhguh," difficult to pronounce for English speakers
	- common in Arabic

##### Newly-introduced manners of articulation
Trill
	- like a rolling a sound
Lateral fricative
	- air is coming down sides of mouth like a lateral liquid


### Other symbols
Sounds that are unique in that they don't fit in the chart


### Non-pulmonic consonants
Sounds made with no air
- Clicks = made by touching articulators togethers
- Implosives
- Ejectives


### Vowels
Organized to parallel the [[Mid-Saggital View]]
When symbols are paired, rounded to the left, unrounded to the right
Rounded = lips are rounded


### Diacritics
Not sounds; symbols that pair with a sound
- Voiceless = can be seen when whispering, or trailing off at the end of a word
- Aspirated = shows "emphasis," extra breath on a sound
- Nasalization = when sounds have a nasal component added
- Syllabic = shows when consonants are used as syllables, usually liquids/nasals
	- "awful" = $[É”fl_,]$ = (difficult to type) diacritic under $[l]$ means syllabic 


### Suprasegmentals
Modifiers for sounds
- Length = long, half-long, short, extra short = show how long a sound is held, measured in time, relative to context
- Stress = primary, secondary stress = show which sounds in a word are stressed


### Tones
Contours in pronunciation
Changes meaning in some languages, like Mandarin
