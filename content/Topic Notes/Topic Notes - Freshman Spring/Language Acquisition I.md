# Language Acquisition
### Theories of Acquisition
##### innateness
humans are coming up with a productive system to understand and create language
language is something humans are predisposed to do
"language with a capital L, not any specific language"
there is a cognitive process / language device that humans use to understand language
an innate capacity for language

there may be some universals that are common to language?
- verbs?
all phonemes/sounds are possible, but after learning your language you don't need the phonemes outside of the lg
- are cardinal directions also innate? but because English is egocentric, we lose the ability to distinguish cardinal directions?

##### critical period
a period at which it seems this acquisition can happen and have it sound like your first language
typically marked at adolescence
this is why it's difficult to acquire languages after middle school/elementary

accent/phonology developed by 6 months old

first 6 months, first 4 years, first 12 years; common critical period "eras"

"if I hadn't had any language up until the age of 12, your brain is unable to learn language"
seen in situations like hearing family w/ deaf child using no sign language
could learn phrases, words, but can't produce new language


### Productivity
how is it possible to generate new words/structures all the time?
actively constructing a grammar as a baby

- ##### active construction of grammar
	"if you show my 6 month old niece a picture of cookie monster giving a cookie to big bird, and a picture of big bird giving a cookie to cookie monster, she may not produce language, but she can identify which picture is which if you ask her to show 'big bird giving a cookie to cookie monster'"
	shows that grammar is developed even before babies can speak

- ##### wug test
	famous experiment showing that children learn grammar, and not memorizing a bank of words and phrases
	used nonsense words to see if the children could add affixes and stuff
	
	adult: here's a wug, there are two?
	child: wugs
	adult: here's a man bodding, yesterday he?
	child: bodded
	
	shows that children are producing language based on a constructed grammar
	this grammar is never distinctly taught to children

##### statistical learning
Charles Yang - linguist researcher
experiment - invented a new grammar, different affixes and stuff
- adults can use this new grammar 60% correctly
- children can use 100% correctly

experiment - parents who learned ASL as a second language, child who was born deaf used ASL as a first language
- parents' ASL was about 60% grammatically correct
- child, who learned from the parents, 100% grammatically correct
don't need caregivers to use grammar 100% correctly; children can still pick up the correct grammar

##### social interaction
needed for language development
need to interact with others in order to develop language

- ##### child directed speech
	aka baby talk
	perfectly fine to do it, but doesn't make a difference in language acquisition
	non-baby talk works just as well as baby talk
	
	(I saw a tiktok before about talking to your children like you would talk to adults and the kids were more eloquent but I saw that like three years ago and don't remember it)
	
	there are cultures where people don't talk to babies, because babies can't talk anyway!
	language acquisition still happens, perfectly fine

- ##### multilingualism
	 learning two or more languages as a baby
	 might go through stages of language acquisition slower, but only like "a week or two" slower, no real impact


### Stages of Acquisition
##### cooing
starts around 3 months up through 12 months
playing around with motor control
even deaf babies will coo, but stop because not interesting/no feedback
"ooo" "wohhh" "mah"

##### babbling I
aka canonical babbling
start practicing sounds over and over
start to be more specific, picking up inflections, using phonemes from the language
starts around 6 months

##### babbling II
aka variegrated babbling
putting various sounds together (not words)
starts around 11 months
stringing together sounds, not just repeating one sound

##### one-word
first word is a big deal in some cultures!
first word doesn't matter in linguistics
shows baby trying to convey a meaning and communicate
a stage of communication
around 8-18 months
around 20 months for a bilingual baby to distinguish what words are from different languages

##### two-word
more meanings
start to see children using lexical morphs
[[Morphology I#lexical morphemes]]
using nouns and stuff
ex. "no, harper" "harper, daddy" "harper, charlie"

##### three-word and beyond
2 to 4 years
start to see syntax
adding in functional morphs
[[Morphology I#functional morphemes]]
closer to adult-like language
ex. "charlie bit me" "that really hurt"
using syntax correctly, just small sentences
