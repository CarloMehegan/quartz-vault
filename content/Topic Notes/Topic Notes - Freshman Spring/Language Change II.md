# Language Change II
### Comparative Reconstruction
how we figure out how old, lost languages worked
how they sounded, how grammar worked, etc

##### majority principle
the sound in the proto language occurs the most often in cognates from its children language
ex. 'biblioteca' from [[Language Change I]]
- French was the odd one out, so it is likely the most different from the proto language's word for 'library'


##### most natural development principle
the sound in the proto language developed in the most likely way crosslinguistically
see [[Language Change I#Sound Change]]

ex. assimilation
- assimilation causes 
	- voiceless -> voiced between vowels
	- consonant clusters become reduced
- think backwards with these rules

ex. lenition
- lenition causes
	- stops -> fricatives
	- final vowel disappears
	- consonants become voiceless word finally

use these sound changes backwards to see how the proto language changed into its children languages

### Examples of Comparative Reconstruction
| 1     | 2     | 3    | gloss     |
| ----- | ----- | ---- | --------- |
| mube  | mupe  | mup  | 'stream'  |
| abadi | apati | apat | 'rock'    |
| agana | akana | akan | 'knife'   |
| enugu | enuku | enuk | 'diamond' | 
we know these 3 languages are all part of a family
what is the proto language of this family? 
go sound by sound and try to deduce
note: the symbols in the tables above and below represent sounds I just don't have time to add all the $[formatting]$
| 1     | 2     | 3    | gloss     | proto |
| ----- | ----- | ---- | --------- | ----- |
| mube  | mupe  | mup  | 'stream'  | mupe  |
| abadi | apati | apat | 'rock'    | apati |
| agana | akana | akan | 'knife'   | akana |
| enugu | enuku | enuk | 'diamond' | enuku |

Notes
for row 1
- would third sound be 'p' or b?
	- 'p' becomes a 'b' because of assimilation
	- likely because it has two vowels surrounding it, so voiced becomes voiceless
	- characteristic of assimilation
	- so, we take the 'p' as the sound used in the proto language
for row 2
- do we take the 'i' at the end?
- likely that the i later fell off, not that it was later added
- characteristic of lenition

with this we are able to fill out the proto column and guess as to what the language sounded like
we can learn from the language based on this
language 2 may be used in the same area where the proto language used to be used, because they are very similar according to our data

another example
note: these are not sounds, they are a written record of three languages in the same family
this is more difficult, because this is all from a linguist's transcription, not a native transcription or a transcription of sounds; the person that created this data had to make their own judgement in how each word is spelled

key
1 & 2 c = $[k]$
3 ch = $[Êƒ]$
2 ll = $[j]$
| 1       | 2       | 3       | gloss   | proto   |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| cavallo | caballo | cheval  | 'horse' | caballo |
| cantare | cantar  | chanter | 'sing'  | cantare |
| catena  | cadena  | chaine  | 'chain' | catena  |
| caro    | caro    | cher    | 'dear'  | caro    |

Notes
row 1
- do we take the 'v' or 'b'?
	- is the b becoming a v because of lenition?
row 2
- do we take the 'e' at the end?
	- yes its likely that the 'e' was later dropped

1 is italian
2 is spanish
3 is french
proto is latin
and the proto words we derived match real latin so we got them all correct!
