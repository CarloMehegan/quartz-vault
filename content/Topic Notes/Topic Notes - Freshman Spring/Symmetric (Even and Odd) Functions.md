# Symmetric Functions

#### Synopsis
Some functions can be considered symmetrically "even" or "odd." This distinction is important, because knowing that a function is symmetric lets us simplify processes like [[Integration]].

#### Detailed Definition
*Theorem 1.*
	If f(x) = f(-x) and f is continous on \[-a, a\], then **f is an even function**.
	If f(x) is even, then 
$$
\displaystyle \int_{-a }^{a}f(x)dx = 2\int_{ 0 }^{a}f(x)dx
$$
*Theorem 2.*
	If f(-x) = -f(x) and f is continuous on \[-a, a\], then **f is an odd function**.
	If f(x) is odd, then
$$
\displaystyle \int_{-a }^{a}f(x)dx = 0
$$
