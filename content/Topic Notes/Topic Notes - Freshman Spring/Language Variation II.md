# Language Variation II
### Language Attitudes and Education

##### African American English in Schools
lots of history in linguistic study

video clips from documentary "Do You Speak American?" 2005
made by journalists, not linguists
- ###### Ann Arbor
	- African American kids moving into the city
	- "25 years ago" 1980s
	- "it felt like we were unteachable"
	- former students of MLK elementary school
	- kids were put into special education classes
	- "language shouldn't stop them from being educated"
	- lawsuit taken against the school
	- "a small group of poor black children in a sea of affluent white families"
	- "language is the marker for assumed attitudes"
	- "led to a landmark court decision on Black English"
	- "judge confirmed that the school district was insensitive"

80% of public school teachers in the US are white women
discrimination due to teachers unaware of dialect differences
still exists today
Ann Arbor case was significant for linguistics, linguists testified, one of the first times linguistics was used outside of scholarly study

"Ebonics" Archaic term for AAE
Schools in Oakland recognized the issue, students were speaking AAE, teachers were having a difficult time teaching students how to write and take tests in a standard dialect
Wanted to teach teachers about AAE, wanted to help move students to standard dialect, teach more effectively
Goal to have students code-switch, write/speak in standard dialect
The news claimed that Oakland was teaching students Ebonics, a new language, caused public outrage
Wow sounds familiar

video clips from documentary "The E Word" (about Ebonics) 2015
- ###### Oakland
	- "it's very systematic" (dialect)
	- "they're not misusing American English"
	- "it's structured, children can only pick up language that is systematic"
	- "it's difficult to understand that people speak a language in different ways"
	- "languages differ, they are not inferior/superior"
	- "the relationships between language and inteliigence, decorum, appropriateness, have been naturalized, there is nothing inherent in what sounds appropriate"
	- "even the term dialect, used by linguists as a neutral term, has prejudice"
	- "language becomes high status, dialect is low status"
	- "one of the controversies of Ebonics was calling it a language and not a dialect"
	- "socially subordinate groups will always have their language seen as inferior"
	- "language is identity"
	- "the number one way we have to present ourselves through the world, form ideas"
	- "when you critique someone's language, you are critiquing them"
	- "you haven't earned the privilege to hear me talk any other way than the way I'm talking now" code-switching
	- "if you're talking to someone as if they're not human, what do you expect them to do?"

"what does it mean that I can teach a class without code switching when others have to"
"these ideas are applicable towards any variety of a language"
"it's not about the language, it's about the people"
the controversy continues to have effects

what can we do instead? linguistically informed way of doing this with less controversy
program in LA school system, one of the largest school systems in the US
LA instituted a program not too many years ago to address linguistic issues in education

another doc I didn't get the name of, early 2000s vibes
- ###### Los Angeles
	- "the LA school systems knows their students will need to be, effectively, bilingual"
	- "the biggest misunderstanding is that we're teaching AAE"
	- "they're already speaking AAE, our goal is to get everyone toward using a standard form"
	- "you can't condemn students for the way they speak"

### Linguistic Strategies for Teachers
what would you want to tell a teacher to aid the way they teach linguistically?
- understanding differences between standard English / other variants
- all varieties are equally valid, none are better or worse, have their own rules/grammar
- we all have a dialect, it's not something someone else has
- certain varieties are less accepted than others
- recognize demographics, and who was taught what standards
- difficulty in being taught in a different standard than what is spoken at home
- differences are not inherently deficits
