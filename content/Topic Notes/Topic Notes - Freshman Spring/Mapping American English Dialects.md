### Mapping American English Dialects
Linguistic and Social Variable
- Language varieties vary systemarically on all the levels of language we have studied
- Sociolinguists seek to tie linguitic variables to social variables
	- Just as we did with responses to thank you (ling variable) and different ages (social variable)
- Language varieties are associated with social identities and groups, such as regional, race, socioeconomic class, etc
- Everyone's language is tied to their social identities - everyone speaks a dialect
- In this workshop we're looking at different regions of the US for our social variable and phonology as our linguistic variable

Data from telephone survey in urban ares, collecting naturalistic speech

Looking at six phonological 8features
- "caught" vs. "cot" low back merger $/ɔ/$ and $/ɑ/$
- "iron" monopthongization
- "dude" u-fronting
- "Max" 'mayucks' northern cities shift 
- "no" o-fronting
- "car" non-rhotic
