Reading for CS100 Feb 7


Hut near shore of an island old man and his wife lived inside they were in dire poverty

Their means of livelihood was catching fish in the sea

The net was heavy one day but when the man heaved it up there was only one goldfish

Goldfish asks to be thrown back in the sea, and will "return your kindness by doing whatever you wish"

He throws the goldfish back and goes home

Wife is mad he didn't get help from the goldfish, "abused her husband from dawn to dark"
That's strange wording

He goes and asks for bread
"Go home, you will find plenty of bread"

Wife sends him to ask for a new trough
He gets it
Wife meets him at doorway

Wife sends him to ask him to build a new house
"Go home and pray to God: everything will be done" - repeated multiple times

Wife is even angrier and scolds man for not asking for even more
Wife asks to be a governor
"Good day, wife"
"You boor, how dare you call me, the governor, your wife? Hey there, you servants! Take this peasant to the stable and whip him as hard as you can!"

This poor guy

Wife now wants to be a queen
Goldfish does it again
Man goes home to a castle

"Listen, you old devil"
Wife asks to be ruler of the sea
Man tries to refuse but she threatens to execute him
Goldfish didn't show up until after 3 calls
Goldfish just looks at him and swims away
Man goes back home and finds his wife a peasant again in their hut, back where they started


Thoughts
- A metaphor for God
- The final prayer was too vain and God cast them out


Connections to [[Vasilisa the Beautiful]]
- Evil women
- Help from mystical beings
- "Go home, you will find plenty of bread"
	- Similar to how the doll helped Vasilisa
	- Both could be metaphors for praying to God
- Vasilisa had a happy ending, this story has a bad ending
	- The "evil woman" in V's story had a bad ending though and so did this one
