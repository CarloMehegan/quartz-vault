[[Russian folklore]]

Reading for CS100 Feb 7


I won't take as thorough notes bc I'm tired

- Cat
- Sparrow
- Brave youth

Baba Yaga counts spoons?

Cat and sparrow save youth from Baba

Baba counts spoons again and the youth gets in trouble again but the cat and sparrow save him again

Third day Baba Yaga counts spoons again and the youth doesn't say anything until she counts a third time and he gets in trouble again and the cat and sparrow are too far to hear him call for help

Baba Yaga has a daughter and she tries to cook the youth but the youth tricks her and cooks her

Baba Yaga orders daughter 2 to cook the youth and gets tricked again

Daughter 3 gets cooked too

Baba Yaga gets cooked too

Youth runs home and we find out he's telling this story to the cat and sparrow
"That's what I did with Baba Yaga!"



Connection to other stories
- Also plays with perspective, the youth is likely unreliable based on the final lines


Connection to [[Vasilisa the Beautiful]]
- Baba Yaga is here and the mortar and pestle and broom are back
- Mortar and pestle and broom are described the exact same way
