# Using Google Sites
 In-class lecture on using google sites for CS100 final project

Google Sites
good for a fast, effective site
very simplistic in a good way

tips
- can switch to phone preview to make sure it looks good on a phone
- always use paste as plain text
- cjmehegan.gs.wm.edu -> shorter version of URL
- add an about us block for your team
- serif vs sans serif
	- serif easier on the eyes on paper
	- sans serif better for web viewing
- settings
	- top vs side navigation, you can choose
- nesting pages, drag them together in the navigation

layout
- different block layouts to put together
- can add image, video, text

editing
- 3 tabs at the top: insert, pages, themes
	- can insert a lot of stuff ex. maps, slides, buttons,...
	- can create new pages
	- basic themes to start with

linking pages
- insert link in text
	- highlight text -> insert link -> choose page
