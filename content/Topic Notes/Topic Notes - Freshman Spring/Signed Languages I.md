# Signed Languages
### Why study linguistics of signed languages?
theyre languages
we focus primarily on spoken languages but signed language is equally language
signed and spoken languages go together
signed languages follow the same rules and patterns as spoken languages

signed languages also tell us new information about humans
ex. nicaragua
- had no signed language education
- planned to teach deaf kids something like ASL
- when they brought the kids together in a boarding school, language developed on its own between the children
- "if kids are ready for language and they are together socially, then language happens"

study of signed languages is important as there is dicrimination towards signed languages
advances the education for signed languages


### Myths and facts about signed languages
signed languages cant express meaning as well, cant express certain meanings?
all languages can express all meanings
words can be spelled out when translating; finger spelling
all languages can express meaning, just some are easier at expressing certain meanings

signed languages are made up of gestures?
signs are not gestures, they are words
you can gesture in signed language the same as you can gesture in spoken language
both kinds of speakers use gestures alongside their language
all languages can have gestures but are not made up of gestures, made up of words

signed language isnt as complicated as spoken?

### ASL Grammar
##### ASL phonetics
- ###### primes
	the equivalent of phones

- ###### parameters
	location, movement, hand shape, orientation
	we can see minimal pairs where location, hand shape, and orientation are the same, but movement changes

##### ASL suprasegmentals
seen in asl
facial expressions

##### ASL morphology
can see simultaneous affixes where affixes, root, produced at the same time
ex. father vs mother, change in location (affix) shows feminine/masculine with same hand sign (root)

shows humans can produce simultaneous affixes and process them

##### ASL syntax
spoken vs. signed languages have in common: topicalization

topicalization = putting the most important bit of the sentence first
putting the object of the sentence as soon as possible
not used often in english, seen in mandarin, seen in ASL

topicalization in ASL
can be shown with eyebrows
object signed first
"book, yours?"
"book, boring"


### Deaf Culture
linking language to language users
- as seen with linking language to babies [[Language Acquisition I]]

##### difference between deaf and Deaf
culturally deaf, use capital Deaf
- culture
- deaf users of signed language
- children of deaf adults, hearing but used sign language
deaf
- the medical term
- grew up hearing, developed hearing loss, considers themself not part of Deaf culture

##### cultural activity with deaf culture
alphabet stories
- equivalent of lullabies but for deaf children
- telling stories using alphabet symbols, using words/primes that use the hand shapes corresponding to the alphabet in order
storytelling in Deaf culture is important
- ex. deaf goldilocks
	- combination of signing, facial expressions, miming, very expressive
	- making fun of SEE (signed exact english), TTY (old speech to text machines for phone calls), barriers to being deaf
	- deaf inclusivity, goldilocks and the three bears all bond over being deaf
