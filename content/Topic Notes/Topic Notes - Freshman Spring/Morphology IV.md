# Morphology IV
### Productivity
The idea that we can make new words using our morphology
We don't have a limited amount of words in a language, words change, words are created as we speak them
Morphology is used to make new words
"Shakespeare was a very productive morphologist"

### Morphological Processes
##### compounding
Coming up with a word where you take two morphs (usually free morphs in english) and combining into one word
Not adding an affix, taking two words that are very meaningful on their own

ex. eyeball
ex. smartphone

"Germanic languages are particularly good at compounding"
Really long words

##### reduplication
Repeating morphs

ex. Indonesian "buku" made plural becomes "bukubuku"
ex. English "like someone" vs. "like like someone" becomes affectionate
- happens on the spot
- in english not used much, but can be done in the moment to show emphasis
	- "do you like, run, or do you like, *run* run?"

Malaysian, Indonesian languages use at lot of reduplication

##### suppletion
Replacement of one stem with another

ex. English "good, better, best" and not "good, gooder, goodest"
ex. English "go, went"

Seen most often in very common words
Can indicate complex changes over time, archaic


### Word Formation Over Time
##### analogy
Make new words by comparison to old words

ex. "chairman" meaning person that sits in the head chair
by analogy, can make a new word "chairperson"
"chairperson" created using previously existing "chairman"

ex. old English "hand, hand-s", "eye, eye-en" plural changes
"children" "brethren" -en used to be used as a plural
-s vs -en became confusing
by analogy, started to say "eye, eyes" like they would say "hand, hands"

In mental grammar, may be trying to make the patterns make sense
People wanting to use just -s driving language change
Consciously or subconsciously

##### hypercorrection
A word changing due to prescriptive grammar rules applied to other words
And people not wanting to be wrong!

ex. English "dive" vs. "dove"
in 15th century, people used to say "dived"
ex. English "drive" vs "drove"
this was correct in the 15th century

People were correcting "drived" to "drove"
Then, people would hyper correct, and start to correct "dived" to "dove", even though "dived" was actually the term used

##### backformation
Changing a word in a way that sounds as if the new word already existed (?)

ex. television, "televise"
television came first
televise became a verb after and we used existing grammar rules to change "television" to "televise"

"looks like it was a word all along"

ex. "burglar"
sounds like two morphs because of words like "painter" and "runner"
there must be a verb to go with the noun burglar right?
the word "burgle" was a back formation of "burglar", created after

"the process of getting there was different than expected"

##### ellipsis/clipping
Shortening an existing word 

ex. "advertisement" becomes clipped down to "ad"
or "advert" in British English

ex. "vegetables" clipped to "veggies"
in New Zealand, clipped to "veg"

ex. British "public house", where people hang out and serve drinks and stuff
clipped to "pub"
people talk about "local pub"
clipped to "local"

These examples show differences in clipping in different dialects of the same language


### Word Formation From Language Contact
English goes all over the world (usually violently) and becomes influenced by many other languages
English has a lot of language contact

##### borrowing
Borrowing words from other languages

ex. English "ocean" from "oceanus"
ex. "kangaroo" from "gungaroo"

can happen when a language has a word for a thing that your language doesn't
can also happen when another language's word for something becomes more popular

ex. English "automaton" lost out over Czech "robot"

"English doesn't borrow words it knocks languages over the head and rummages through their pockets"

ex. Japan borrows English "supermarket"

##### calque
also called a "loan translation", "loan word"
which is funny because "loan word" comes from German "lehnwort"

A word from another language is translated directly in a way that it wouldn't usually be translated

ex. English "hotdog" becomes Spanish "perros calientes"
exact translation from english, even though it sounds very strange probably

ex. English "beforehand" comes from the French "avant la main"
not the way it would have been expressed in English, but someone translated the French expression to English

ex. English "how do you do", "how goes it" come from romance languages

"very often when learning another language you'll find an expression that explains something very succinctly and you want to use that expression in your own first language"


### Changes in Meaning
##### broadening
meaning broadens over time

ex. "holy day"
means a day with religious significance
eventually becomes "holiday"
but still meant a religious holiday
eventually the meaning broadened to mean any day that is especially important, even if not of religious significance
eventually started to mean a day/time off, like spring break is a school holiday
eventually becomes "holidays" in British English, where you can refer to "summer vacation" as "summer holidays"
"I'm going on holiday to-"

##### narrowing
meaning narrows over time

ex. Old English "hund" meant dog, any dog
now, there are certain breeds of dog that are referred to as "hounds"

ex. "poet" meant any creator/artist
now, means specifically people who create poetry

-- spring break starts here --

##### folk etymology
the way a speaker thinks about language affects how they are using the language
new words come from "misconceptions" or different understanding of other words

ex. outrage
- separate into "out" and "rage", seems like someone put the two words together?
- it actually comes from latin "ultra" meaning beyond and "agium" meaning a nominative
- pronunciation got morphed into outrage
- keeps the meaning of "beyond" but becomes pronounced "outrage"
- the word "rage" exists in english, so "outrage" started to become related to "rage"
	- this is folk etymology
- "outraged" becomes a word
- now we can say a legitimate meaning of outrage involves anger even though it didn't before

ex. stepchild from "steopcild"
- originally a compounding of the word "step" meaning bereaved and "child"
- bereaved child
- people then analyze what does "step" mean?
- took step and analyzed it as meaning a member of a new family
- now we have "stepmother" which doesn't mean a mother who is bereaved or a mother who is an orphan, just a mother with a stepchild
- stepcousin, stepfamily, these words come from the expansion of the meaning of stepchild

look at oxford english dictionary for interesting word meaning change history stuff

##### taboo
"everyone's thinking about it"

ex. toilet
- mild taboo word
- "toil" a fabric you put clothes in a "toilet"
- people started using toilet to mean the cloth you put over your dressing table, high society
- people start to broaden the meaning of toilet from the cloth in the 1500s to the dressing table and articles on it in the 1700s
- started using toilet as a verb, the act or process of dressing or doing your makeup, "making your toilet" from the 1700s
- "toiletries" come from the dressing, makeup meaning of toilet
- became the room, toilet room
- in 1800s, becomes a euphemism like "powder your nose", "make your toilet", "go to the toilet"
- the euphemism becomes the meaning of what it is trying to cover up
- toilet starts to take on taboo
- starts to mean the actual furniture toilet the "porcelain lavatory plumbing fixture" 1890s dictionary would say
- eventually "use the toilet" means "use the toilet"
- toilet paper comes after the taboo, not associated with makeup
- British english "water closet" "WC" went through similar process
- "bathroom" "restroom" are new euphemisms
- UK uses "toilet" as a euphemism, not taboo
- Canada uses "washroom" as a euphemism
- tell dogs to "do their business"

taboos show differences over time, differences in different places, cultural differences
