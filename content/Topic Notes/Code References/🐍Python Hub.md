# Python Hub

### Welcome
I'm using this page to keep track of notes related to Python so I don't forget commands and I can save code snippets for later

### Pages

[[Python command cheat sheet]]
- min()
- split()
- strip()

[[Kattis - Sum of the Others]]
- problem I attempted in class but got wrong
