## Linear System

A [[Linear System]] is a collection of one or more [[Linear Equation|Linear Equations]] involving the same variables (such as $x_1 ... x_n$).

A **solution** of the system is a list of numbers ($s_1, s_2, ... , s_n$) that makes each equation a true statement when the values are substituted for the variables ($x_1, x_2, ... , x_n$) 

##### What if there are multiple possible solutions?
The set of all possible solutions is called the **solution set** of the linear system.
If two linear systems have the same solution set, then they are called **equivalent**.

##### Finding the solution set
With a system of two linear equations, the solution set can be found by graphing the equations and finding the intersections.

There are 3 possible solution sets for a system with two linear equations
a. The lines intersect (1 solution)
b. The lines are parallel and don't overlap (no solutions)
c. The lines coincide (infinite solutions)

A linear system is called **consistent** if it has at least one solution, and **inconsistent** if it has none.

Linear systems can be recorded compactly in an array called a [[Matrix]].
