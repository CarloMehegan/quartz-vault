## Notes on documentary
- Since I first got a sense of myself I considered myself a Korean even though I wasn't sure what it meant
- We are in educational front line of Chongnyeon, an association of pro North Korean residents in japan
- providing national identity to our students ... a lifeline
- Seems like everybody's having a good time
- Students speak Japanese better
	- connects to that thing from linguistics
	- It's more useful to speak japanese
	- like when that dad taught his kid Klingon to see if he could learn it and he did but he stopped using it and eventually forgot once he went to school and interacted with more people; English was more useful and used everywhere
	- these kids don't use Korean outside of school
- The Korean we use is becoming a localized language
- Wearing traditional costume in Hokkaido s chilly weather is not easy
- In South Korea you can passively keep your identity you don't need to exhibit it but for Korean residents in Japan if you don't demonstrate it it will fade away - You are becoming Japanese inside and out and you lose your sense of identity that's why we have to wear traditional costume and stick to the Korean language
- Why do boys wear blazers and not traditional costume
- One of the students made a joke ab a South Korean actor they probably like
- Nice school bus
- Seems like they're all well-off
- Now ~30-40 studwnts in the dorms, at one point >200
- Spent 12 years from primary to high school in their dorm
- Teachers are passionate
- I could not spend all day and night around kids
- "But now it is so quiet" :doom:
- 12th grade won the singing contest
- Practice words in learning Korean: close, sickle, fatherland
- One on one policy pairing a transfer student with another student to interpret what teacher is saying bc transfer students have to catch up in learning korean
- Student that transferred in tenth grade - "I hated being Korean", denied she was Korean, didn't understand why she was even Korean, "I should have been born Japanese"
- "If you speak in Japanese you lose a point"
- "My classmates couldn't speak to me in Japanese because they would also lose a point, so I couldn't say anything"
- But then class president said you won't lose points for speaking Japanese with a transfer student
- "I've changed since I came here" school left them better off as a person
- "A very strong sense of identity"
- Around 45:30 mark we hear a first generation parent talk about the history
- We have to achieve unification of Korea as soon as possible, we are stronger when we're united
- Teachers visit families including far away ones during the summer
- Try to get more students during these trips
- One of the parents said "it is us who are growing up, we are growing up together"
- "This recruiting trip gets harder and harder as I get old, because you feel empathy for the parents. You can't imagine how much parents think of their children."
- "When I was single I told the parents I would take care of the kids as if they were my own but I'd didn't know what that really meant until I became a parent myself"
- Japanese guy that became a soccer coach "I saw a totally different world from the one I was living in" "their smiles were so bright"
- Coach learned Korean for a year with the transfer students
- Weight lifting team has won records, but they aren't officially recognized as part of a league and have to pay their own expenses like for travel to competitions
- "They think because we are Korean, we will bring good players from Korea to each competition"
	- Feels like a lot of arguments I've heard before
- Women's basketball team always has to play safe, say it's because there's only 5 or 6 members on the team so they don't have substitutes if they get injured

- "I feel very close to them" talking ab South Koreans
- 12 graders(?) are getting a trip to the father land
- The director wasn't allowed to go with them to North Korea but got to see their ship set sail
- "There has been no shadow of division cast between me and the students of the school. But when I saw them off, I clearly understood for the first time in my life, that my country is divided into two."
- Skips to them coming back from pyeongyang
- "After the two week trip, students seemed different to me. They always talked about the people they met in NK, they always sang songs they learned in NK, I was curious to know what they saw and whom they met. I have a camera to Jaehoon before he went to NK so that I could feel a little bit of what they experienced."
- "I was touched by their warm welcome" no discrimination
- Did they see a fat kid on the side of the street

- "Such sweet people, they were real people"
- "I was wearing better clothes than they were"
- "I was ashamed because I was not sure if I had a strong sense of identity"
- "I saw the dividing line ... it was so small, I thought it was so tragic the country was divided by such a meager thing"

- "70 million Koreans will sing with joy on the day of unification"
- "In august 2006 when I was busy putting the final touches on the film o received a letter from Mr. Shin"
- "Teachers take turns to keep a night vigil. The situation is so grave that now the class of the new 12th grade might not be able to visit the fatherland because the entry of North Korean vessel is blocked for 6 months."

Ok well now I have to write the comments about it
What do I say even

Our School follows a North Korean school for children living in Hokkaido. The documentary gave me a feeling similar to the feeling I get from American Southern Gothic literature; an underlying sense of division and grief among this group of people. In Southern Gothic works this feeling comes from seeing people recuperating their lives after the Civil War, still suffering from the effects it had on them and trying to suppress these issues. The feeling is similar here because the conflict the school faces is only mentioned briefly a few times during the second half of the documentary, where it can't be avoided anymore. We see multiple types of division, including the division that comes from Japan's efforts to naturalize first generation Koreans, like the parents of the students in the documentary, and then from Japanese activists protesting against the North Korean school. We even see the division between North and South Korea, and hear how the students wish that one day the country would be united so that they can live in peace.
