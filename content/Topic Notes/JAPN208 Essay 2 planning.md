- or about the guy near the end the painter talking about he was already dead in prison and hes come back

ok ill search the work death and die and dying and list every example in order i find
- Bobbie Kumasaka
	- A sob wrenched itself free from the breast of the mother whose son was once again dying, and the snow-white head bobbed wretchedly.
	- “Germans, Americans, accident, those things are not important. It was not the boy but the mother who is also the son and it is she who is to blame and it is she who is dead because the son did not know.”
	  “I just know that Bob is dead.” 
	  “No, the mother. It is she who is dead because she did not conduct herself as a Japanese and, no longer being Japanese, she is dead.” 
	- “And the father? What about Mr. Kumasaka?” 
	  “Yes, dead also.” 
	  “And you, Ma? What about you and Pa?” 
	  “We are Japanese as always.” 
	  “And me?” 
	  “You are my son who is also Japanese.”
	- “That makes everything all right, does it? That makes it all right that Bob is dead, that war was fought and hundreds of thousands killed and maimed, and that I was two years in prison and am still Japanese?”
	  “Yes.”
	  “What happens when I'm no longer Japanese?”
	  “How so?”
	  “Like Bob, I mean. What happens if I sign up and get shot up like him?”
	  “Then I will be dead too.”
	  “Dead like me?”
	  “Yes, I will be dead when you go into the army of the Americans. I will be dead when you decide to go into the army of the Americans. I will be dead when you begin to cease to be Japanese and entertain those ideas which will lead you to your decision which will make you go into the army of the Americans. I will be dead long before the bullet strikes you. But you will not go, for you are my son.”

this is like the role of the korean mothers in teaching their children japanese when they were being assimilated

- Kenji vs Ichiro
	- So they sat silently through the next drink, one already dead but still alive and contemplating fifty or sixty years more of dead aliveness, and the other, living and dying slowly. They were two extremes, the Japanese who was more American than most Americans because he had crept to the brink of death for America, and the other who was neither Japanese nor American because he had failed to recognize the gift of his birthright when recognition meant everything.
	- But a leg that was eating itself away until it would consume the man himself in a matter of a few years was something else, for hobbling toward death on a cane and one good leg seemed far more disastrous than having both legs and an emptiness that might conceivably still be filled.

- Sleeping
	- THERE IS A PERIOD BETWEEN EACH NIGHT AND DAY WHEN one dies for a few hours, neither dreaming nor thinking nor tossing nor hating nor loving, but dying for a little while because life progresses in just such a way. From that sublime depth, a stranger awakens to strain his eyes into focus on the walls of a strange room. Where am I? he asks himself. There is a fleeting sound of lonely panic as he juggles into order the heavy, sleep-laden pieces of his mind's puzzle. He is frightened because the bed is not his own.
- Kenji
	- Then maybe there is no someplace else. Maybe dying is it. The finish. The end. Nothing. I'd like that too. Better an absolute nothing than half a meaning. The living have it tough. It's like a coat rack without pegs, only you think there are. Hang it up, drop, pick it up, hang it again, drop again…
	- “He was a good boy, pleasant, thoughtful, well-liked, but never really happy. The others, they seem not to mind so much. They say to themselves this is the way things are, and they are quite happy. He was not that way. He was always asking why things had to be the way they were. For him, I often think I should have never come to America. For him, I think I should have stayed in Japan, where he would have been a Japanese with only other Japanese, and then, maybe, he would not now be dead. It is too late now for such thoughts.”
- Ma
	- Dead, he thought to himself, all dead. For me, you have been dead a long time, as long as I can remember. You, who gave life to me and to Taro and tried to make us conform to a mold which never existed for us because we never knew of it, were never alive to us in the way that other sons and daughters know and feel and see their parents. But you made so many mistakes. It was a mistake to have ever left Japan. It was a mistake to leave Japan and to come to America and to have two sons and it was a mistake to think that you could keep us completely Japanese in a country such as America.
	- With me, you almost succeeded, or so it seemed. Sometimes I think it would have been better had you fully succeeded. You would have been happy and so might I have known a sense of completeness. But the mistakes you made were numerous enough and big enough so that they, in turn, made inevitable my mistake. I have had much time to feel sorry for myself. Suddenly I feel sorry for you. Not sorry that you are dead, but sorry for the happiness you have not known. So, now you are free. Go back quickly. Go to the Japan that you so long remembered and loved, and be happy. It is only right.
	- If it is only after you've gone that I am able to feel these things, it is because that is the way things are. Too late I see your unhappiness, which enables me to understand a little and, perhaps, even to love you a little, but it could not be otherwise. Had you lived another ten years or even twenty, it would still have been too late. If anything, my hatred for you would have grown. You are dead and I feel a little peace and I want very much for you to know the happiness that you tried so hard to give me…

	- Time, how slowly it passes. I will hope and wait and hope and wait and there will come a time. It must be so. She is dead. Time has swept her away and time will bury my mistake. She is dead and I am not sorry. I feel a little bit freer, a bit more hopeful.

- Emi
	- “It's because we're American and because we're Japanese and sometimes the two don't mix. It's all right to be German and American or Italian and American or Russian and American but, as things turned out, it wasn't all right to be Japanese and American. You had to be one or the other.”

- idk where
	- “The young Japanese hates the not-so-young Japanese who is more Japanese than himself, and the not-so-young, in turn, hates the old Japanese who is all Japanese and, therefore, even more Japanese than he...”


I can frame this with each character
- Bobbie
- Kenji
- Ma
- Gary
maybe pa at the end as the one who survives
also freddie he dies right at the end idk what to make of that

Bobbie 
- introduces the idea
- died in the war
- Ichiros' mom says that his mother is the one who is dead, because her son went off to war
- By joining the US army, Bobbie lost his identity as Japanese
- and his mom died because she let this happen
- "no longer being Japanese, she is dead."
- and the father too
- the whole family has lost their identity because they failed the son
- "I will be dead when you begin to cease to be Japanese and entertain those ideas which will lead you to your decision which will make you go into the army of the Americans. I will be dead long before the bullet strikes you."
- dead as soon as they lost their japanese identity
- whatever that might mean
- conceding, surrendering

Kenji
- very different
- doesnt have the same family issues
- fought in the war
- died later
- "They were two extremes, the Japanese who was more American than most Americans because he had crept to the brink of death for America, and the other who was neither Japanese nor American because he had failed to recognize the gift of his birthright when recognition meant everything."
- kenji did what ichiro didnt and we see the direct comparison, parallel between them
- ichiro wishes he could trade with kenji, he feels as if hes already dead
- would kenji be more content than ichiro is, if roles were reversed
- kenji is "more american"
- ichiro is "neither japanese nor american"
- whats the difference?
- 

Mrs. Yamada
- fully japanese
- hysterically japanese even
- if ichiro went to war, she would mo longer be japanese, and she would be dead
- at the end when she starts to accept the evidence that japan really lost, she commits suicide
- connection to [[Into the Light]]
	- in that story, we see the similar role of a mother
	- as Haruo accepts his japanese identity, mother is left behind
	- represents role of korean mothers during korean assimilation in japan who were to teach their children japanese instead of korean
	- used to create imperial subjects, japanese subjects, and kill the korean identity
	- when the mother dies, and the children grow up, the korean identity is gone
- mrs yamada fights against this
- her son will lose his japanese identity, and she will be dead, family lineage, culture, ancestry cauterized
- sbe and her husband came to america to get rich
- theyve lived in america for so long without bothering to become american, or, actively fighting it, or, never even considering it
- or at least she hasnt
- 

it is said that men die twice, once when the physical body dies, and finally when they are remembered for the last time
john okada proposes a death before these, a half death, when the mother tongue is lost, when cultural identity is challenged

this first death as losing the minority identity
aka becoming an american and not being japanese
or beocming neither american or japanese
is it possible to be japanese american
ichiro chasing this death
mom fighting it

ichiro doesnt know who he is anymore
american or japanese

identity crisis
should i look at each characters identity crisis or death
or like
identity in the framing of death right and how each character talks about death or how death as a concept is used with them

---

It is said that men die twice; once when the physical body dies, and finally when they are remembered for the last time. In *No No Boy*, John Okada describes another death: the loss of identity. After serving two years in prison for refusing to enlist in World War II, Ichiro Yamada finds himself back home not knowing who he is anymore. The novel follows Ichiro .... back home .... other people going through identity crises

These characters use death to describe the loss of their identity in different ways throughout the novel
And by looking at each character's narrative on death, we find 
A full range of characters affected by the war
And by

And by going through these ... mentions of death ... we see that Okada describes a third type of death: the loss of identity.

thesis?
- the use of death ... identity ... shows that
	- identity is the reason ichiro is conflicted
	- what ichiro and his mom fight is identity
	- Ichiro chases this death, while his mother fights against it
- the use of death in describing 
- Okada's consistent use of death throughout No No Boy represents the loss of identity, particularly Japanese identity, that the characters struggle with throughout the novel. Each person Ichiro meets represents a different identity crisis and a different perspective of death. Through these perspectives, Okada describes the loss of inherited identity as a third kind of death.

##### Title
No No Boy and the Death of Identity

##### Intro first paragraph
It is said that men die twice; once when the physical body dies, and finally when they are remembered for the last time. In *No No Boy*, John Okada describes another death: the loss of identity. After serving two years in prison for refusing to enlist in World War II, Ichiro Yamada finds himself back home not knowing who he is anymore. The novel follows Ichiro as he wrestles with what it means to be Japanese-American and if there is any hope for his future. He visits old friends and family and finds the novel explores their postwar struggles as well. A consistent theme of the novel is death, both literal and figurative, with characters described as half-dead, close to dead, already dead, or even reborn. Multiple characters die during the few weeks that the book spans. Through this, Okada tries to portray how he feels about the identity of Japanese-Americans as a whole.

##### Thesis statement i guess second paragraph
Okada's consistent use of death throughout No No Boy represents the loss of identity, particularly Japanese identity, that the characters struggle with throughout the novel. Each person Ichiro bonds with represents a different identity crisis and a different perspective of death. Through these perspectives amd through these deaths, Okada builds up the loss of inherited identity as a kind of death, and this death, both the fight against it amd desire for it, create the main conflict of the novel.

##### Death 1. Bobbie Kumasaka
After reacquainting with his family, Ichiro and his mother visit the Kumasakas, another Japanese family, to celebrate Ichiro coming home. Ichiro is surprised to find out that their son Bobbie enlisted in the army and died on the battlefield. Later, Ichiro's mother says that she didn't tell him about his death because it was unimportant. "It was not the boy but the mother who is also the son and it is she who is to blame and it is she who is dead because the son did not know” (Chapter 2). Because Bobbie's mother couldn't stop him from joining the American forces, it was her fault that he had died, and further, she was dead because she had failed in keeping him loyal to Japan. With Bobbie, we see the idea of being dead while alive, because of a failure to stay attached to Japan and detached from America.

##### Death 2. Kenji
Ichiro's mother has similar feelings about Kenji, Ichiro's friend who enlisted in the army. The war took Kenji's leg, an injury which eventually led to his death. Kenji and Ichiro are described as "two extremes, the Japanese who was more American than most Americans $[...]$, and the other who was neither Japanese nor American" (Chapter 4), further emphasizing Ichiro's lack of identity. Kenji is almost the complete opposite of Ichiro, and Ichiro wishes he could trade places with him. He wanted to trade away his frustration with what he did for an infected leg that could soon kill him. This shows how Ichiro feels he is already dead, because he has lost his identity, and has no hope in figuring out who he could be. Of course, the trade isn't possible, but the kindness Kenji shows Ichiro throughout the book is a key contributor to the hope he feels at the end of the story. With Kenji, we see the opposite of Ichiro, but both still dead in different ways.

##### Death 3. Mrs. Yamada
During the Kominka movement in Japan, when the empire attempted to expand and assimilate Korea and Taiwan, Korean mothers played an important role in assimilation. Korean language was prohibited and Korean mothers raised their children to speak in Japanese dialects, not Korean ones. Ichiro's mother fought against this very thing happening with her children in America. She stayed loyal to Japan and refused to learn English or become any closer to the country. The war only heightened her patriotism, which evolved into hysteria, believing that Japan were the real victors.

After her death, it feels as though a weight has been lifted off of Ichiro and his father. With her death, they could finally learn to embrace America. Where the Korean mothers in Japan were forced into making their children Japanese, Mrs. Yamada fought to keep her children from becoming American. Ichiro was being pulled on one side by the woman who raised him and on the other side by the country he was raised in; "because one is not born in America and raised in America and taught in America and one does not speak and swear and drink and smoke and play and fight and see and hear in America among Americans in American streets and houses without becoming American and loving it" (Chapter 1). It wasn't until her death that this tension ended, letting Ichiro see the world with new eyes and the ability to find his own identity. With Mrs. Yamada, we see death enabling Ichiro to let go of his past identity. Her death was Ichiro's death, the death Ichiro had been chasing; letting go of the Japanese part of his identity, his mother's identity, to build a new one.

##### Death 4. Gary
After his mother's death, Ichiro begins looking for work and is led to an old friend, another no-no boy named Gary. He finds purpose in life through painting, and feels reborn; "I died in prison. And when I came back to life, all that really mattered for me was to make a painting" (Chapter 10). Where imprisonment broke Ichiro, Gary found new meaning in life; new identity. Though their experiences are different, Gary may serve as a glimpse into Ichiro's near future, since Gary was released from prison earlier. While talking to Gary, Ichiro remembers the kindness shown to him by the man who offered him a job working with Gary, the man in Portland who offered a good wage, and he thinks about Kenji and Emi. At this point, Ichiro begins to realize the world isn't so bleak, and there may be hope for him after all. With Gary, we see that it's possible to go through what Ichiro went through and still find identity and passion in the end.

##### Conclusion
Throughout the book, Ichiro is shaped by the deaths of those around him, eventually being able to find a glimmer of hope by the end of the book. He begins to understand what it means for him to embrace America and rebuild his identity that was destroyed by his mother and the war. Through the framework of death, we see how Japanese-American identity was brought into the spotlight during the war and just like how many lost their lives, many lost their identity as well. However, rebirth is possible, and this chance to live life anew fuels Ichiro to keep living.

"Because we're American and because we're Japanese and sometimes the two don't mix. It's all right to be German and American or Italian and American or Russian and American but, as things turned out, it wasn't all right to be Japanese and American. You had to be one or the other.”
