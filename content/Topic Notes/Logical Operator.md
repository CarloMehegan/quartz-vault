## Logical Operator

##### Unary Operators
operators that only take one argument/proposition
there are 4 total
1. $\neg$ negation - flips a proposition
2. ɪ identity - leaves a proposition as is
3. an operator that makes a proposition always true
4. an operator that makes a proposition always false

(the only useful unary operator is $\neg$)


##### Binary Operators
operators that take two arguments
1. ∧ and - conjunction
2. ∨ or - disjunction
3. ⊕ exclusive-or - one has to be true, not both - "either-or"
4. → [[Implication|implication]] - if p holds, then q does as well
5. ↔ equivalence/biconditional - both must have the same value

how many total are there?
- with two variables, there are 4 possible combinations of true and false
- there are $2^{2^2} = 4^2 = 16$ possible binary operators
- the ones listed are the ones most useful to us
- sidenote: there are $2^{2^1} = 4^1 = 4$ possible unary operators

order of operations is ¬,∧,∨,→,↔
parentheses can override this order

In order to visualize and work out all of the operations that these operators represent, we use [[Truth Table]].
