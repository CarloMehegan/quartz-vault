---

purpose of this reading for us is to gain some terms and concepts for our analysis of travel writings in the upcoming weeks

what kind of source?
- secondary, because Pratt is analyzing other sources, interpreting other data

what are the author's motivations and goals?
- analyzing the european bias in travel writing

terms from the reading

###### contact zone
- a zone where two cultures encounter
- synonymous with term "colonial frontier"
- often one culture is indigenous
- uneven power balance
- comes from the linguistic term [[Language Change III|Contact Language]]; a language that emerges when two cultures encounter, usually for trade and such
- (YEAHHH!!! EPIC COURSE CROSSOVER!!)

###### anti-conquest
- the European bourgeois seeking to secure their innocence while also asserting their power
- the "seeing-man" - "he whose imperial eyes passively look out and possess"
- helps the bourgeois feel more comfortable and justified in their actions
- "im just a silly little foreigner traveling in a foreign land"
- could also be justified as missionary work - spreading the word of God
- propaganda to trivialize the power imbalance

###### autoethnography / autoethnographic expression
- "instances in which colonized subjects undertake to represent themselves in ways that engage with the colonizer's own terms"
- ex. the *New Chronicle* talked about in the reading
- not thought of as authentic or autochtonous forms of self-representation
- "If ethnographic texts are a means by which Europeans represent to themselves their (usually subjugated) others, autoethnographic texts are those the others construct in response to or in dialogue with those metropolitan representations"
- ex. enlightenment is a European idea; people outside of Europe using the terms of Enlightenment to represent themselves and fight against imperialism
