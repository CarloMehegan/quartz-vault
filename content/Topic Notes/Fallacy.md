## Fallacy
Fallacies are common mistakes in validating arguments.
Using "rules" that resemble [[Tautology|Tautologies]] as [[Rules of Inference]].

##### Fallacy of affirming the conclusion
$((p \rightarrow q) \wedge q) \rightarrow p$
This proposition is not a tautology, because it is false when $p$ is false and $q$ is true. Many incorrect arguments are incorrect because they treat this as a tautology. Remember that "correlation $\neq$ causation." Forgetting this is what typically leads to the fallacy.

ex. 
If you do every problem in this book, you will learn discrete mathematics.
You learned discrete mathematics.
$\_\_\_\_$
Therefore, you did every problem in the book.


##### Fallacy of denying the hypothesis
$((p \rightarrow q) \wedge \neg p) \rightarrow \neg q$
This proposition is not a tautology, because it is false when $p$ is false and $q$ is true (much like the proposition in the last fallacy).
This is "the opposite" of the fallacy of affirming the conclusion.

ex. 
If you do every problem in this book, you will learn discrete mathematics.
You did not do every problem in the book.
$\_\_\_\_$
Therefore, you did not learn discrete mathematics.


Both of the examples are not valid arguments. There are other ways of learning discrete mathematics besides doing all of the problems in the book.
