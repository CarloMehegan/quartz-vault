1.1

## Linear Equation

Linear equations (using the variables $x_1 ... x_n$) are written in the form
$a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n = b$

In textbook examples, n is usually 2-5, or around 2 to 5 terms/variables in the equation, but in real life examples n might be 50, 100, 1000, etc.

Note that the variables **do not** have exponents, because otherwise it would not be a **linear** equation

A [[Linear System]] is a collection of one or more Linear Equations involving the same variables (such as $x_1 ... x_n$).
