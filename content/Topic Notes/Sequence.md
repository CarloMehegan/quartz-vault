## Sequence
A sequence is a discrete structure used to represent an **ordered** list. It can be defined as a function $s: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow S$, for some set $S$.

##### Arithmetic Progression/Sequence
$a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ..., a+nd$
arithmetic sequences are defined by adding a number $d$  to a number $a$
these terms are described using $a_0, a_1, a_2$

##### Geometric Progression/Sequence
$a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ... , ar^n$
geometric sequences are defined by multiplying a number $a$ by a number $r$
$r$ is called the factor of the sequence

We want to capture the way something increases or decreases at discrete steps. To do this, we define [[Summation|Summations]].
