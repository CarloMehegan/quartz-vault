## Uniqueness

A solution set of a [[Linear System]] is considered unique if it is the only solution set of that linear system.

One way to tell that a solution set is unique is whether the linear system contains [[Free Variable|Free Variables]]. If the solution set of a linear system contains free variables, then there are infinitely many solutions, and the solution set is not unique.


A linear system can be:
1. [[Consistence|Inconsistent]]; no solutions
2. Consistent and Unique; one solution
3. Consistent and not Unique; multiple/infinitely many solutions


#theorem
##### Theorem: Uniqueness of the Reduced Echelon Form
Each matrix is row equivalent to one and only one [[Reduced Echelon Form|Reduced Echelon Matrix]].
