## Final Project: Chinese Hero Fantasy
This site is organized into a timeline of fantasy novels, either Chinese fantasy works or works inspired by Chinese fantasy. Specifically, Chinese "hero" fantasy, a term used in this project to describe the fantasy "-xia" subgenres such as [Youxia](Youxia.md) and the subgenres that stem from them. See the [Genres](Genres.md) page for more information on these genres, with an explanation of their evolution throughout history that can serve as an alternate way of viewing this project.

This project details how Eastern fantasy has had an increasing influence on Western fantasy works over time, and especially in recent years, by going through specific works one by one. Each page contains a description of the plot, history of the work, and notes on how the work contributes to the main idea of growing influence. The interactive graph at the bottom of each page displays the links and backlinks between that page and others, effectively showing how topics are connected.

## Notes
I planned to format the timeline in a more dynamic way, but unfortunately was unable to get it to display on the website itself. All of the content is in place, but not organized as prettily as I would have liked and the metadata associated with each page wasn't able to be used.  
If I were to continue this project, I would continue to find works to add to the timeline, and maybe explore more niche subcategories like LitRPG more. What I enjoy the most about this format is that it can be infinitely expanded, and with more time I could continue to flesh out this site.
