## Hero Fantasy
This site is organized into a timeline of fantasy novels, either Chinese fantasy works or works inspired by Chinese fantasy. Specifically, Chinese "hero" fantasy, a term used in this project to describe the fantasy "-xia" subgenres such as [Youxia](Youxia.md) and the subgenres that stem from them. See the [[Genres]] page for more information on these genres and their evolution throughout history.

This project details how Eastern fantasy has had an increasing influence on Western fantasy works over time, and especially in recent years, by going through specific works one by one. Each page contains a description of the plot, history of the work, and notes on how the work contributes to the thesis.
