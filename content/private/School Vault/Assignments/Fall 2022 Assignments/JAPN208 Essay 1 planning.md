## Essay 1 planning
##### prompt
Write an 800 word paper on Isabella Bird’s Unbeaten Tracks in Japan in relation to the analytical concepts that Pratt introduces in her Imperial Eyes, such as “contact zone.” First, explain these concepts, and then, discuss how these concepts can be applied to the analysis of Bird’s observations of Japan. When you write your paper, pay attention to the following:
1.  Your paper should not be simple summaries of the readings. It must have an argument
2.  Use concrete examples to support your argument.
3.  Organize your argument within 800 words. A significantly longer or shorter paper will be marked down.
4.  Remember that one important purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that you did the readings, attended the lecture, participated in class discussion, and successfully synthesized the information thus acquired into your argument.

##### ideas
contact zone
-   bird as her own contact zone
-   tokyo as a contact zone
-   treaty ports as contact zones
-   varying levels of contact in places with more/less travelers passing through
-   hokkaido/aino tribes as contact zone within contact zone
    -   europe : japan :: japan : ainos
-   contact going the other way; her writing is “first contact” for many westerners; she wasnt only first contact for the people she met in japan
- can tie into ling220 [[Language Change III|Contact Language]]
anti-conquest
-   "im just a silly little foreigner traveling in a foreign land”
-   says travel is for her own health
-   the mask slips at points
    -   bird’s ego
    -   comparing herself to jesus in that one excerpt
    -   says japanese people corrupt european children
-   was she aware of the power she held while traveling?
autoethnography
"instances in which colonized subjects undertake to represent themselves in ways that engage with the colonizer's own terms”
-   japanese people adopting western clothing
-   aino people using japanese artifacts for their own religion / significance

whats my argument?
- Isabella Bird is a moving contact zone throughout Japan
	- For japanese - first european woman they may see
	- For europeans - first time reading about japanese culture
		- Non-politically focused writing
- Whether she is aware of it or not, she is a "protagonist of the anti-conquest"
	- Her claims for traveling are innocent; for her health, for new experiences,
	- She is unintentionally paving the way for those after her
	- She has an ego and looks down on the Japanese people she meets
		- Measuring them like livestock
		- Almost never referring to them by name
			- Meanwhile almost all of the european people she speaks to are named
		- "When I went out I found fully 1000 people helping me realize how the crowded cities of Judea sent forth people clothed much as these are when the Miracle-Worker from Galilee arrived, but not what the fatigue of the crowding and buzzing must have been to One who had been preaching and working during the long day."
			- Comparing herself to Jesus as a "miracle worker"
		- Followed immediately by
		- "These Japanese crowds, however, are quiet and gentle, and never press rudely upon one. I could not find it in my heart to complain of them except to you."
			- One of the few good things she says about the Japanese (and it's about how obedient and docile they can be)

##### Thesis
Bird's journey through Japan's interior was not only the first time many indigenous Japanese people encountered European culture, but also the first time many Europeans read about Japanese culture. Her travels, whether she knew it at the time or not, would pave the way for other foreign travelers in Japan, contributing to the country's rapid globalization.

##### Intro
In Isabella Bird's *Unbeaten Tracks in Japan*, the English traveler documents her journey through the interior of Japan in 1878. The book is made up of the letters Bird sent to her sister throughout her trip. Bird enters the country in Yokohama, one of the first ports Japan opened to global trade, and from there travels to Tokyo. She prepares for her trip with the help of her European acquaintances living in Tokyo, and travels on foot, horseback, and boat throughout the country, ending in Hokkaido. 


In her letters, Bird writes about her encounters with Japanese cultures and the hardships she faced, mostly complaining about the quality of living in the villages she stays the night in. As the journey goes on, the reader gets an understanding of Bird's feelings towards Japan. She looks down on the people she meets and finds their living inferior, but revels in the opportunity to study them like a newly discovered species. In one encounter, as a crowd gathers around to see the foreigner that rode into town, she remarks, 

"When I went out I found fully 1000 people helping me realize how the crowded cities of Judea sent forth people clothed much as these are when the Miracle-Worker from Galilee arrived, but not what the fatigue of the crowding and buzzing must have been to One who had been preaching and working during the long day."

While she goes back and forth throughout the text between indifference and derision, this quote where Bird likens herself to Jesus Christ shows the height of her ego. She portrays herself as the innocent traveler in a strange land, but still sees herself as the most distinguished individual in the village.


##### descriptions
As Pratt describes it, a contact zone is an area where cultures encounter, especially in an imperial setting and one culture has power over another, indigenous culture.

The anti-conquest is an idea, or even a state of mind, where the colonizing party seeks to claim their actions innocent while continuing to assert their power.

Autoethnographic expression is described by Pratt as instances where the colonized take on the colonizer's culture, especially in an attempt to fight or otherwise engage the colonizer on the colonizer's terms.
