[[CHIN309 Reflection 3 - Scratch]]
[[CHIN309 Reflection 3 - Final]]

ok time to try and write this again
tomorrow i get to go home but first i gotta do this

##### Final project proposal

For the final project, I have two ideas which both relate to the last two reflections. The first idea is continuing reflection 1, where I looked at the Will Wight's book series *Cradle*, its influences, and the meaning of its popularity. The series has heavy Daoist influences and throughout the readings for class I've found parallels to Cradle's story. The series is also based on the Chinese genre of xianxia, with the author in an interview saying he wanted to bring this genre of stories to a Western audience. This idea has been a success, and the series' last few installments have reached number one on Amazon's book list and number one in the New York Times bestselling audiobook list during their release. Cradle is categorized as progression fantasy, and I believe we will see stories like it become more popular in the future. While I've read other progression fantasy stories, I've read little xianxia, and for the final project would like to read a couple of these books, compare them to both Cradle and the readings from class, and see if I can chart out the influence of Chinese literature through this chain of works. I want to clearly define xianxia, wuxia, and cultivation,

I want to understand the differences between xianxia, wuxia, and cultivation, show their influences (especially how they were influenced by the works we've discussed in class), show their histories as genres, where they are today, and where I think they will go in the future: to broader, global audiences. 

The project will be split into two parts. One part will be a deep dive into the history of Chinese fantasy, tracing back xianxia and wuxia's influences and histories. The second part will be reading some of these works and comparing them.

There is a line that can be drawn from *Cradle* all the way back to [[Records of the Grand Historian]] and with this project I'd like to trace what we've learned in class to works being written today.

This is relevant to the class because these works I consider literature. In the project I could explore what literature means through the lens of Chinese fantasy and why 

In the project I could explore the meaning of literature and argue the importance of these Chinese fantasy works as literature

"Cultivation fantasy Xianxia, meaning “immortal heroes,” is a Chinese fantasy genre that focuses on characters who undergo meditation and training to become transcendental beings. It is often called “cultivation fantasy” by western readers. ... They eventually improve enough to achieve immortality."

Jim Yong (real name Louis Cha Leung-yung) died recently Oct 30 2018, and his works are being translated now
I wonder if I can use his story in draming this stuff
ok not sure if i can but pretty cool guy i might want to read The Legend of the Condor Heroes for the project


cradle $\leftarrow$ progression fantasy $\leftarrow$ cultivation $\leftarrow$ xianxia $\leftarrow$ wuxia $\leftarrow$ y



While looking into the series for reflection, I learned more about the genres that influenced the story, namely *xianxia*, *cultivation*, and *wuxia*, all Chinese fantasy subgenres.

For ten years I have been polishing this sword;  
Its frosty edge has never been put to the test.  
Now I am holding it and showing it to you, sir:  
Is there anyone suffering from injustice?
