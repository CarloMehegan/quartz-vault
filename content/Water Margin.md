## Water Margin
##### About
The [Water Margin](Water%20Margin.md) is a novel written by Shi Nai'an, set in the Song Dynasty. The story is about 108 outlaws who use martial arts to fight against corruption. The Water Margin is considered an early [Wuxia](Wuxia.md) story, because the 108 outlaws fit the description of martial heroes and its exploration of themes like loyalty, brotherhood, and social justice. The work is considered one of the four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, and has inspired countless adaptations in other forms of media like television and [video games](https://store.steampowered.com/app/521680/Bandit_Kings_of_Ancient_China/).

##### Notes
In class, we read the chapter where Wu Sung fights a tiger. To me, Wu Sung embodies the idea of a wandering vigilante hero that is so common in [Youxia](Youxia.md) and [Wuxia](Wuxia.md) stories. The way that the Water Margin uses so many characters also reminds me of huge wuxia works like [Legends of the Condor Heroes](Legends%20of%20the%20Condor%20Heroes.md).
