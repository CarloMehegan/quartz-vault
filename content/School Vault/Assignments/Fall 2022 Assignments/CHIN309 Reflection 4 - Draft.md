> Please submit a reflection based on material we have covered through November 3rd! Don't feel the need to cover everything. You can simply discuss your favorite piece, something interesting that came up in class, or even discuss how you've encountered the topics at hand outside of class.
>     
> **If you like you can use this as a project proposal for your final project!**
> 
> Tell me what your planned topic is, why you find it interesting, and describe the materials you plan to use (don't worry, you can change your mind about your project at any time). If your project is not easy to translate into a word-count, propose an alternative way of assessing total content,  **and I will consider your proposal and let you know what the plan is.**
> 
> **Otherwise, the same as usual:**
> 
> You have a variety of options for format:
> 
> 300-500 word reflective essay/pastiche of a reading  
> 5-10 minute podcast  
> 5 minute video  
> 5-page comic book
> 
> For written materials, please submit your work as a .docx, .md, or .txt file. Audio files can be .mp3, .wav, or any other common file format (a link to something like SoundCloud is also fine). For video, mp4 or avi files are fine (and alternatively, you can submit a link if the video is hosted on a service like YouTube). If you need to submit visual materials (for a comic book, for instance), .jpg, .png, .tiff, or .pdf files are all fine!
> 
> Remember: I will grade these based on coherence, but what this means varies depending on what you submit: if you make an argument, do you present adequate evidence in support it? Does your pastiche follow the original in an evident way (feel free to provide additional explanation if you think it might not be clear)?  Is it clear what message you are trying to get me to take away, and so on). Presentation also matters: is the material grammatical, well structured, and so on. Finally, content is important: is there a clear relationship with course materials, does it demonstrate a mastery of them?
