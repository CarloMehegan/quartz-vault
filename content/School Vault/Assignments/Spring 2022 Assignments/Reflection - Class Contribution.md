### Reflection: Class Contribution
##### Prompt
Take a moment to reflect on how you are contributing to learning in this class: to your own learning, your classmates’ learning, and my learning. Examples of contributions could include making your own study aides, doing additional outside reading, coming to offce hours … joining a study group, asking and answering questions in class, doing problems on the board … emailing me a linguistics blog, cartoon, or article … and so on. Create a refection on your contribution to the class, covering these questions: 

• What are the specifc instances in which you have contributed to learning? 
• What ways of learning linguistics have been most helpful for you? 
• How do you plan to participate in learning linguistics during the rest of the semester? 

You may use any format, including creative ones. Responses in essay format should be about 250-350 words; audio 'podcasts' should be 1 – 2 minutes max. Your refection will be assessed for thoughtfulness and thoroughness; your overall class contribution will be assessed separately at the end of the semester.

##### Ideas
ways i contribute
- notes
	- ive been taking pretty notes
	- organized like a wiki
	- i spend time outside of class to make them useful
	- i create flashcards out of my notes (lie)
	- i could just talk about obsidian if i need more words
	- my notes are easy to share
	- i can search through my notes
	- ill have access to my notes in the future
	- working on website
	- https://carlomehegan.github.io/my-notes/
	- website doesnt work but i want to have all my notes here by the end of the year
- getting to class
	- im still late sometimes but ive been doing better as the semester goes on
- in class
	- i stay engaged and keep notes

• What are the specifc instances in which you have contributed to learning? 
sharing notes
• What ways of learning linguistics have been most helpful for you? 

• How do you plan to participate in learning linguistics during the rest of the semester? 


#####  Response
My class contribution is mostly in how I take my notes. For the last few months, I've been trying to find systems that let me keep notes virtually. I'm currently using Obsidian to accomplish this. My goal is to be able to find items in my notes quickly and be able to share my notes online. Obsidian is helping me towards those goals, and it is what I have been using to write all of my notes for this class.

Structurally, I have been following the paper handout templates for our notes, but keeping them virtual makes it easier for me to link information together and find what I need. I also use virtual flashcards in Obsidian in order to memorize vocabulary.

Obsidian formats notes using Markdown, which is a markup language like HTML. This means I can easily convert the files to PDF for sharing, which is what I did for the first note-sharing assignment. My main goal is to be able to upload my notes to my own webpage, so I can link people to them. I'm working on making this site now and wanted to have it ready for this reflection, but it's [still under construction](https://carlomehegan.github.io/my-notes/).

Implementing this note system takes some extra effort, but I believe that it will be worth it to have everything I learn in a searchable, sharable format. This is especially useful for this class since we practice note sharing. I plan to participate in learning linguistics during the rest of the semester by continuing to refine these notes, and be able to share them during my note sharing slot.

In terms of learning, I learn best from examples and from structured notes. By structured notes, I mean having the vocabulary we need to know laid out, like in the paper handouts we have in class. This structure helps me figure out exactly what I need to know, and examples do that as well. Really I just enjoy the structure of the class and don't have any suggestions.
