# Phonetics Assignment

### Prompt
Part 1: International Phonetics Alphabet • Make yourself physical or online fashcards for the American English consonants and vowels. Match the symbol to the parameters; for instance, [p] > voiceless bilabial stop, [i] > high front unrounded tense, etc. • Practice with your fashcards until you have all the symbols and parameters memorized. Being familiar with this subset of the IPA will be useful for almost every unit in the course. Even though you can reference the charts for assignments, it's super helpful to recognize some symbols right off! • To turn in: Attach a photo (convert to pdf) of your physical fashcards OR put a link (make sure no password is required) to online fashcards in the Comments box

Part 2: Phonetic Transcription • Transcribe your own pronunciation of the list of words on the next page. • To turn in: Attach a legible pdf of your transcriptions to the same Bb submission as Part 1 (handwritten will require scanning the page or converting a photo of it to pdf; typed will require copy-pasting IPA symbols or using an IPA font)
