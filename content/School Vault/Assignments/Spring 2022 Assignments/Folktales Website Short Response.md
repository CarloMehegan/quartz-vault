### Prompt
Write a short response to the web site, ([http://ft.obdurodon.org)](http://ft.obdurodon.org/) discussing the site’s “readability”: 1. its utility as a tool for exploring the subject, 2. Identification of specific research questions that the site can answer, and 3. Overall user experience (design, interface, interactivity, etc.).

### Response
1
good tool as a starting point
bad tool bc russian cant read
good tool bc interesting use of data
good example of distant reading

3
could be improved in design and using data in more interesting ways

The Exploring Speech in Russian Fairy Tales study is a useful example of how distant reading can be utilized to analyze the structure of a text beyond its storyline. By using XML to find speech verbs in Afanasyev's collection of Russian tales, the people behind the website are able to find how actions and speech differ between genders in these tales. 

There are some issues with the readability of the project. One is that most of the studied text, like the verbs they collected, are left in their original Russian, with no translation to go along with them in the data visualizations. It makes sense that the data should be collected from the original Russian texts and not a translation, however it would be helpful to the reader if the graphs and tables were translated after data collection. A reader could use a translation tool, but these tools are unable to convey the nuance of certain speech verbs. This would be like translating "instructed," "reprimanded," and "coached" all into "said" or "taught." This nuance is also critical when analyzing how frequently these speech verbs are used for different genders.

The data they found could also be used in more interesting ways. They collected information on how frequently each character's name was said in each story, but they didn't use this data in their final visualizations. With the data from this study, others could do research into how frequently certain epithets are used, how frequently certain recurring characters are used, or how a recurring character's role differs depending on the "type" of story.

Despite these gaps, the study is able to effectively delve into its topic and come to the conclusions it was looking for. The study's methods of data collection are novel (to our class, at least), and could be used in future distant reading projects.
