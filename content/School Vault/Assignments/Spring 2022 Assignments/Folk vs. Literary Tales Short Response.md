# Folk vs. Literary Tales Short Response

### Prompt
How are descriptions of characters and settings in folk tales different from those in a literary tale? To what effect? Consider detail; (external) action vs. inner world (motivation, thoughts, etc); use of figures of speech (metaphors, similes/comparisons). Provide 2 examples from Gogol and folk tales.

### Response
In folk tales, the story rarely, if ever, uses a first-person perspective. Folk tales were passed down orally, and because of this they are told from the perspective of a narrator. Many literary tales use narrators as well, but first-person perspectives are also used by literary tales to gain insight into a character's thoughts.

This difference in perspective highlights the biggest difference between folk tales and literary tales: folk tales are about actions, and literary tales are about characters. This isn't always the case, but literary tales tend to focus more on fleshing out characters than folk tales do. Folk tales will sacrifice having interesting characters in order to have the characters take interesting actions.

This is because folk tales aren't meant to create interesting characters; they are meant to impress a lesson on to those who listen to them. We aren't meant to sympathize with the daughters that are sent to Baba Yaga; we're supposed to learn to obey our elders. We aren't meant to explore Vasilisa's character; we are meant to pray to God when we need help. The usage of names like Vasilisa or Ivan reinforce the idea that the characters are stand-ins used so that the listener can picture themselves in the story. In a folktale, the reader should come away remembering a lesson. In literary tales, the reader comes away remembering characters.
