Hello it is 9:31 and I'm texting from my PHONE! I'm in the library been here for a little over two hours did the midterm practice feeling awesome I should go over the formulas before the midterm maybe make flash cards if I'm feeling crazy

I just got obsidian synced to my phone it just used iCloud I got it on my laptop and now I am here texting you instead of typing I'm not sure what to do now it's 9:30 I already said that but I thought I might be here longer but I don't have anything to do so I think I will go to the caf market get sushi or something bc I'm getting hungry again then go back to dorm eat the sandwich/sushi and then maybe wash dishes and definitely foot spa and then play monster hunter and get in bed

Do I have a reading for cs to do I never checked 

It is 11:12am gonna get in bed bc I'll feel awesome if I do that rn and not in 3 hours from now
