Ok priority for tonight is to do the discrete topic notes and the hw
Hw maybe tomorrow but topic notes def tonight
And maybe Linear algebra topic notes? I'll need those soon

Also I have not checked any of those week 2 boxes, what does my review look like for weekly notes? Also I should make weekly notes like to recap these daily notes because there's a lot of stuff I write down here to remember and then forget bc this isn't Notion

I need to read the analects too! For tomorrow
Man I got a lot to do

Omg bujo tonight I can figure out the topic notes there yeah yeah
Reading I can do before class and tonight

ok im at bujo what will i do i can
- math topic notes for 1.3
- discrete topic notes for (?) whatever topics weve gone through so far up to lecture 4 i think in the lecture notes idk what it is in the textbook also should i use the textbook? idk i fell off

I didn't do much at bujo we watched spirited away it was so distracting that's a whole movie!
