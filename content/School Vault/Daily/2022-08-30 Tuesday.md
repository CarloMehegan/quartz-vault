### Tuesday, Aug 30

Went to sadler with charlotte and richard and charlottes roomie and then met charlottes pet rat 15 also richard mentioned the Three Body Problem I really should read that then I went back to dorm

Registered for software development and dropped competitive programming, current plan is to go to class this week and pick one of these courses to drop (probably the Japan literature one) and then add competitive programming back in before Tuesday bc it never fills up so there should still be a spot

Then went to ra meeting it was boring then did laundry and downloaded more textbooks I got the books for software development they're recommended reading Code Complete and then one other one that seems boring then I went to Wawa got a chicken sandwich I also went yesterday but forgot to track it I got a pretzel and Oreos and junk anyways after Wawa today I went to the club fair and signed up for fasa again I should go to the first meeting it's a dinner next week now I'm walking home writing this

"Prose consists less and less of words chosen for the sake of their meaning and more and more of phrases tacked together like sections of a prefabricated henhouse"
-George Orwell

Heard this quote in cortex 129 51min ish and it makes me think about what I was reading in the Code Complete book and how the book calls writing code "construction" makes me realize how writing and speech really is about constructing things



Hooooly I tracked so much today I'm insane
