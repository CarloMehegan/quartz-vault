it is now midnight and ive completed all of my stuff for week 1 all assignments readings and topic notes Except for the csci243 topic notes but i want to wait anyways before i start those so that i can figure out the structure for them (this is the lie i am telling myself so i can go to bed (im not sure if ill go to bed yet actually and im hungry and i got a caf takeout container i might eat that hotdog))
