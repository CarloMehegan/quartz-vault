### Sunday, Feb 27

It is 3:12pm I need to read [[Crime and Punishment]] part 1 and 2 today and I'm currently on page 10 but I don't feel like it so I'm procrastinating I'm sitting outside the library at a thermoplastic picnic table just chilling and I am going to try to do python practice with Kattis so that 1 I can be a god at competitive programming class and 2 I can practice code even though I don't have any cs classes I can stay sharp and be cool

Bam check this out

[[üêçPython Hub]]

Very cool I want to keep track of my kattis problems and like have cheat sheets because I always forget python commands so compiling everything in this page ^ will be sick

That was fun I read for an hour including when I was falling asleep and I did code problems for an hour after that idk what I'll do now I guess read bc I have a lot to read still I think I'll see if its still cold outside I came in to read and because it was getting cold but there's so many people here and I'm falling asleep ok bye

It is 8:09 I'm back at my dorm I went to the ISC and read on a comfy couch and a comfy chair and then another comfy chair then I went to the caf and now I am back at my desk for some reason I thought Crime and Punishment part 2 ended at page 88 but part 1 ends at page 88 and part 2 is page 196 and I am only at page 41 oops so the plan now is to finish part 1 before I get in bed tonight then continue into part 2 and finish it tomorrow night so that means for class I'll only have read part 1 but it'll probably be fine I think I'll read a part 2 synopsis

It is 12:48 am and I can't believe it's already the last day of february that is twisted I have not finished part 1 of crime and punishment I just finished chapter 4 of part 1 so there's two more chapters left
I also just transcribed the phonology project from notebook to the actual handout I'll just turn in this paper tomorrow
