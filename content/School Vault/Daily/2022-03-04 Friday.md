Ling Workshop - Morphological processing

Morphology: the study of words
- You store roots in your mental lexicon
- You know morphemes
- You know rules
- These things combine to allow you to generate and understand complex words productively

Lexical access : the proces of identifyinh words, or retrieving them from your mental dictionary
On average: 4-5 syllables per second, 100-130 words per minute
You are doing lexical retrieval at a rate of once every 0.5 seconds!

Lexical decision task: see a string of letters on the screen, decide if it is an English word or not
This is what we just did in the lab experiment
Tells us how long it takes you to access a word in your lecixon
We can compare how long it takes you to find a word in your lexicon

The conditions of our study
- No affix - free morphemes
- real affix - words that have one affix - runner, decode
- pseudo affix - appear to have an affix - father, resume
- nonce no affix - novel words that do not appear to have affixes
- nonce affix - novel words that appear to have an affix

We expect words with an affix to take longer to parse because we are looking at the root in order to decide if the word is real
