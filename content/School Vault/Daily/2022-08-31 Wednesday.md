### Today's fleeting notes

[[2022-08-31 CSCI243]]

[[2022-08-31 MATH211]]
Ok class is over that was very hectic and maybe difficult to read jumping between ipad and laptop in that room sucks because the desk is so small and it takes a bit to transition and i had to do it 5 times in like 25 minutes so i should either take all the notes in goodnotes and then translate that to obsidian topic notes or maybe write all in excalidraw and like get an ipad keyboard or honestly i really didnt write all that much text well hmm maybe i keep a goodnotes journal for this class and then i add like figure numbers to reference in obsidian because im still writing definitions but if im gonna do that i might as well just keep doing this
ok in class ipad only just goodnotes then i upload those notes to obsidian as pdf as fleeting notes and then i translate those to topic notes? also i have like homework now for this class right i should do that also theres the detailed notes shes giving lets see if those are substantial and maybe i can use those
another important thing is that i hate writing in excalidraw it is not fun and does not feel write goodnotes is way better

Couldn't take notes because weird no technology policy but just went over syllabus and talked about what class will be I gotta do " the hardest reading of the whole semester probably" now ugh

How is there another class after this I'm probably gonna drop one of these Chinese classes because it's too much for one day I won't be done until 6:30 it's too late and then soon that means it'll be dark by the time I get out of class I will die I'm gonna drop whichever alv has the most work maybe this one

I'm so tired
ok just reorganized the whole vault basically made new folders and put every file in a folder and made a fleeting notes template so i should just be able to make the daily note then tap the class and start writing
now lets try to start some topic notes with todays info
