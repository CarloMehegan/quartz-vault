- math hw 1 (DONE ALREADY! did it at the caf bc im awesome)
- discrete hw 1
stuff for later

- cs project 1

ok well thats not too bad i will start with the cs lecture
its been like a hour since i said that and ive done a foot spa but not the lecture i dont feel like doing it rn tbh!


dataview plugin is gonna ruin everything (like in a good way) this does like everything i want i might replace notion??

```dataview
TASK
WHERE !completed
```
LOOK I CAN JUST SEE ALL MY TODOS
TODO FINDER PLUGIN DEAD
its a little bit ugly tho
ok i dont think this task list alone will replace notion its not as pretty and it doesnt have all the fields and beefiness that my notion homework table does also not really a good history view

oh hey this is my 100th daily note slay
wait no there was a duplicate
this is the 99th
