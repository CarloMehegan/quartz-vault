ok what do i want to do for the chin reflection
it is 7:21 pm i just finished the math hw 2 ill turn it in tmr i think
i wanted to start the chin reflection and get to like part 3 or 4 of the cs project today but ill start with the chin reflection bc i want to get it out of the way

![[2022-09-19 CHIN309#Reflection 1 rubric]]
here is the rubric
i will do the 300 to 500 word writing bc thats the easiest
i was thinking ab something like the ling reflection i did last year using notion card views or making like a timeline but im not sure how applicable either of those things are and i dont know what i want to write about

what can i write a reflective essay about?
- the white horses are not horses thing
	- talked about paradoxes in discrete so like there's a fun crossover
- can i make any connections to readings from japn208?
- can i make any connections to progression fantasy/xianxia/wuxia?
	- not really because i havent read any but cultivation would be a great topic to talk about
	- maybe for a future project in this class
- "You can simply discuss your favorite piece, something interesting that came up in class, or even discuss how you've encountered the topics at hand outside of class."
	- whats my favorite piece? maybe the analects?

i just spent like 10 min making a list of the readings in [[ðŸ§§CHIN309 Hub]]
still not sure which one to do the reflection about

completely unrelated just checked my obsidian graph thing
![[Pasted image 20220929194800.png]]
how can anyone use this thing in any useful way
it sure does look cool
nothing but an onboarding tool

ok i still dont know what to write about
heres an idea
i go back to my dorm and finish my weekly dungeon or whatever before the week ends tomorrow morning and i watch videos about confucius while i do it yeah perfect great idea i could connect it to who knows probably something right? caf closes in ten min lemme grab something to eat again and then leave ive been here for like 4 hours
