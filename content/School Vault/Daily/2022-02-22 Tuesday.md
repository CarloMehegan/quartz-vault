### Tuesday, Feb 22

Hello I woke up at 7:05 am today and I've been up the whole time now it is 6:30 pm and I am in the library I want to finish the reading for cs and then go back to the dorm and get in bed

Also obsidian icloud sync is the worst I moved back to a folder on the desktop it was making twenty copies of files and syncing every thirty seconds while I was writing and ruining the sentence I was on whatever I'll try something else I guess

Ok time to work bye

Ok I finished it's 8:30 pm wow exactly 2 hours with only like three little breaks I'm gonna go back to the dorm now I have completed all assignments I need to there is nothing left on my plate I am free to relax it is time to chill and soak my feet and go to bed at a reasonable time
