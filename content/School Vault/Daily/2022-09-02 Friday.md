### Today's Fleeting Notes
[[Fleeting Notes/2022-09-02 CSCI243]]
[[Fleeting Notes/2022-09-02 MATH211]]

ok i have an idea for like a check mark in the title of the fleeting notes to show that theyve been reviewed or like one check mark means assignments have been put into notion and second check mark means all info has been extracted from the document

it is 7:49 do i wanna leave myself hw to do over the weekend or do some now?
ill make a list of what ill have to do

- make 1.2 math topic notes
- review the last 3 days' fleeting notes also i should make a weekly fleeting note
- ok i made that weekly note and it has a list of hw
- im not tired but my brain is asleep so im done working for tonight
