### Thursday, Jan 27
No class on Thursdays which is weird I wish I could find a way to fit a CS class in my schedule also I did nothing productive today I hope I'm not already burnt out of my routine after like two days I did take a night shower tho I've got a four day night shower streak and I read a lot today but I also played a lot of Minecraft

I did one assignment actually I renewed the SAS accomodation but actually I didn't renew anything because I don't need to renew the AC accomodation but that's one less thing to worry about now
