### Monday, Aug 29

I'm so sore how did I track like 16 hr yesterday every waking moment I was workin

Caf is awesome but so so far

How do I want to annotate textbooks? How do I pair GoodNotes and obsidian

Downloaded textbooks for discrete structures and linear algebra and read the introductions
(See Fall 2022 Syllabi in Notion)
Wait can I just link to Notion
https://www.notion.so/carlomehegan/Fall-2022-Syllabi-5d6ef12107124c93881019c52e783e2a


I think I should have a folder off in class fleeting notes and a folder of textbook/refined notes based on a topic maybe the textbook notes should be included in fleeting notes? No the practices I do can be considered part of the fleeting note folder and then refined notes for each topic (what a topic is could be based on vocab or glossary entries in the textbook) are a separate folder
Fleeting notes titles could look like
Class 15: unit 2.8
Or whatever and then topic notes are like
Linear equations

I should watch like a crash course on like a brief history of China so that I'm prepared for these two Chinese lit classes I don't know anythingChinese lit classes I don't know

- [ ] Go over these notes about obsidian and good reads
