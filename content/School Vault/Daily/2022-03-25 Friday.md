workshop
- notes on previous workshop (spoken vs written language)
- can we encode all spoken language in writing?
	- certain emotions are difficult to convey, like sarcasm, uncertainty, laughter
	- some conventions, like questions and exclamation
- encoding written language in spoken
	- difficult to convey changes over time
	- words written over words
	- stylizing of font
	- format
- is written language glottographic?
	- no
	- has its own complexities


workshop
- [[cross-linguistic investigation: syntactic typology]]
- categorization by structure
- how languages organize themselves
- not categorization by history

parts of sentences
- verbs, action word of the sentence
- subjects, the do-er of the sentence (there are exceptions but not in our data today)
- objects, the do-ee of the sentence (there are exceptions but not in our data today)

order matters
- in english, order matters, daisy licks toby is not the same as toby bosses daisy
- english default order is SVO
