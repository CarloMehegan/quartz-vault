talking about syntax system

syntax systems allow language to combine
- sounds (~30 distinct sounds)
- words (~60,000)
- sentences (unlimited)
this system allows us to generate infinite new sentences
this means we need a system for processing and mapping words onto syntactic structures in a way that is very fast, efficient, and flexible

can we see evidence of people building structure in real time
- are we building structure as we go?
- or waiting until we get enough information to be sure about structure?
method
- "self-paced reading"
- reading sentences word by word
- comprehension questions after

We can give participants a predictable end to a sentence as a baseline
- these reaction times should be fast
And compare this to a less predictable end to the sentence
- these reactions will likely be slower as predictions are subverted
We read the critical word reaction time where the sentence structure becomes definite, and then the next 3 "spillover" words where reaction time may also slow

Basic sentence - DO - Direct Object
- NP - VP - **NP** (predictable)
- "the dog chased **the** children in the..."
- critical word **the**
Subversive sentence - GP - Garden Path
- NP - **PP** (unusual)
- "the dog chased **by** the children in..."
- critical word **by**
Maybe difference is because of complexity, so we add a control for complex
Structurally matching sentences to the GP's - MOD - Modifier
- NP - **PP** (complex, but predicted preposition)
- "the dog that was chased **by** the children in..."
- critical word **by**
