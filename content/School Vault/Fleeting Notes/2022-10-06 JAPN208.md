(i read the wrong reading i was looking at next week's)

## Christina Yi reading

##### presenters
kominka
focuses on kokugo, one of the main policies of kominka, revolved around language
looked at the story [[Into the Light]] and a nonfiction work about language, by Tokieda Motoki
politics behind readings of characters' names in first print and reprint of the story
by the end haruo's mother is essentially forgotten by the story
one must reject the tools by which they are constructed
gendered aporia of empire - contradictory stance of unifying the empire while dividing it by gender

key points to analyze policy 
address gender aporia
aporia means contradiction/paradox in theory/argument
contradiction within imperialization of japan
female subjects are left behind
kokugo - national language in japan
distinction between kokugo used in korea and nihongo in japan
still a distinction in language, hierarchy
kokugo is japanese, but still doesnt absolve you of korean identity, but allows you to assimlate into japanese empire
haruo's mother is the only person represented with bad japanese
haruo doesnt come to terms with his korean identity with his mother, he does so at the end with nam
mother is left behind
both haruo and nam figureheads of good imperial subjects
mother tongue affects peoples identity, needed to promote education of korean women, in order to pass kokugo to their children
use the mothers as tools to teach children then forget about them
the mother's mother tongue is korean, but supposed to pass on kokugo as mother tongue to their children
goal to create imperial subjects, women and mothers meant to be left out

distinction between kokugo and nihongo
banning native languages in school
forced adoption of colonial subjects with japanese names
mothers have to teach kokugo to their children
kokugo necessary for marginalized subjects
language of the mainland vs. kokugo and other purposefully bastardized versions
mother has to pass on versions of lanugage that are not hers
have to discard remnants of your marginalized heritage
kokugo is not the japanese language


##### Questions for the reading
- Narrators name is Minami/Nam. What argument does the author make about the politics of these readings?
	- names were written differently in print vs. reprint
	- original version in the outlet *Bungei shuto*, consistently [[gloss|glossed]] in katakana script
	- when you write names in katakana, its like translating, depicts them as foreigner names
	- katakana is usually used for foreign words
	- hiragana used in reprint
	- nan/minami is represented as one hiragana character, pronunciation changes, and that is shown by the katakana
	- in second print, japanese reading is glossed only the first time the name shows up, and not for the rest
	- assumption that readers read japanese
	- "this small but telling change transforms the narrator's internal struggle from an either/or choice - either Japanese or Korean - into an and/or dilemma of "Korean and/or imperial subject
	- first printing shows words as equal
	- later printing way more skewed towards japanese - no choice
	- looks like a minor change, actually very telling in context about the narrator's own internal struggle
- What is the "hierarchy in the configuration of local imperial identity" (p. 824)?
	- so tired and sleepy
	- korean reading for his name - "Nan"
	- real korean pronunciation should be "Nam"
	- in japanese words dont end with "m" so in japanese journal they use "Nan"
	- reader is supposed to be someone who knows japanese - a japanese person
	- unmarked reader
	- author himself used "Nan"
	- structurally speaking there is no way to write "Nam" in japanese
	- Yi is making a point of this change
- How does she critique Tokieda Motoki's theory on "national language"?
	- in Motoki's theory mother plays an important role
	- mother learns kokugo, passes it on to children
	- Motoki critiques linguistic idea that there is no link between language and object
		- the word "bag" has no intrinsic connection to an actual bag, could be any word
		- Motoki refuted this, says there is connection, spirit of national culture,. whatever
		- cultural meaning
		- if you learn language at school, its a tool for communication
		- if you learn language from your mother, understand cultural connection
	- Yi critiques Motoki's ideas
		- mothers native tongue isnt kokugo, so how would she be able to pass on this culture that is not hers to her child
		- how can korean mother play this role in indoctrinating children into japanese culture when she is not a member of that culture
		- aporia emerges from this situation
		- "The burden of history falls on the maternal figure split between her own mother tongue (Korean) and the mother tongue (Japanese) that she is to impart to her child."
		- how are children supposed to separate from their mother in this way
			- haruo's character shows this strife, inhibits growth
		- japanese language is already split into many dialects
			- how can culture be tied to it in this way, how can kokugo be so different and lower than other japanese, when theres already dialects and differences
			- language doesnt work the way Motoki wants it to
	- what about when this is put into practice, korean mothers teaching kokugo, what happens
		- "While Tokieda's essay ends without addressing this conundrum of the mother, in Into the Light we may catch a glimpse of what happenes when one follows Tokieda's proposal to its logical conclusion: abjection."
		- abjection - rejecting something you cant completely reject/object
		- mothers are pushed away
- How does she read *Into the Light* in relation to this theory?
	- talked ab allrdy
- What is the "gendered aporia of empire"?
	- talked ab alrdy too

"wanted to give you an example of a close reading of a story"
