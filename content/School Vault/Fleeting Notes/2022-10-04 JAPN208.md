description:: discussing [[Into the Light]]

talking today about Kim Sa Ryang's Into the Light

before that one more thing to talk about from last week
"Japan and Korea as One Body" (*Naisen ittai* "japana-korea-one-body")
talked last time about Konminka movement, total assimilation; this movement was around the same time
important symbol; marriage between Nashimoto Masako and Yi Un, japanese princess and son of koreas last emperor
"japan used marriage politics quite effectively"
Nashimoto Masako and Yi Un remained married even after Korea's liberation, moved to Seoul
different from european colonialism; racial difference was important; didnt want colonizers to marry colonized

## [[Into the Light]] by Kim Sa-Ryang
first impressions?
- characters very well written
- very engaging story
- story moved at a calm pace, able to explore a lot of how people felt at the time
- interesting that story wasnt entirely censored
- easy story to understand, prose isnt deadly like usual

##### presentations
kim sa ryang was a korean writer during japanese colonization of korea
stories embody his experiences
koreans are treated as inferior
nam takes on name mr minami
haruo serves as antagonist in the beginning, treats being korean as inferior
revealed that haruo isnt fully japanese
main point of tension is acceptance/denial of these character's korean identities

attending university
focus on separation between people in japan
many conflicts happening throughout the story
nam accepting his real name shows him accepting whats happening; is it good or bad
relationship between haruo's parents reflects relationship between japan and korea

##### questions from last week
- What "borders" does Kim's story draw our attention to?
	- japan and korea is the obvious one
		- koreans did not want to assimilate
		- seen as two different national communities
		- different treatment for koreans in japan
		- historical context
	- linguistic borders
		- use of korean/japan to show relationship between different people, convey a different tone in conversation
	- so sleepy and tired im gonna fall asleep i hate tuesday
	- im so tired im gonna fall asleep so sleepy
	- identity as a border, psychological border
		- koreans have to accommodate their identity as foreigners
	- koreans going to japan, but also japanese crossing borders to go to korea
		- koreans are second class citizens in japan
		- japanese are not treated in a similar way when they go to korea
		- power imbalance
		- koreans going to japan for work, need money
		- japanese going to korea, for travel, vacation, sightseeing
		- also japanese going to korea to assimilate it, make it more like japan
	- economics as a border
		- korea, more agrarian
		- japan, more industrial
		- story focuses on working class neighborhoods in tokyo
- What tensions and conflicts can you observe in this story? Where do these tensions and conflicts derive from?
	- "full of tension and conflict"
	- gender tension
	- tension in how koreans view their identity
	- tension in korean relationship to japanese society
	- when yi brought haruo's mom to school
		- think the author is trying to characterize yi as someone who despises assimilation
	- conflict between yi and nam
		- if koreans took japanese names, theyd have better job security
		- its suppressing korean identity
	- nam criticizes himself
	- oh is the main character a teacher
	- i shouldve read this thing
- What does this story tell us about ethnic, national, cultural, and imperial identity?
	- interesting that the story takes place in japan, characters are already settled in japan
		- "all of them have already accepted that korea has been imperialized"
		- no matter where they go japan or korea theyll be under japanese rule
	- parents of half korean half japanese kids want their kids to abandon korean identity
		- haruos father has internal conflict
		- haruos father is half korean half japanese haruos mom is full korean
			- sidenote haruos mom was indebted and worked at a brothel and haruos father paid off her debts and thats why shes so loyal to him
	- mixed people are drawn to their korean identity even when they denounce it
	- japanese and korean people ethnic identity is blurred; they look similar, they can pass for each other, how does that change things? when usually imperialism takes place over colored lines
		- needed to make differences distinct, cultural, etc
		- goes against konminka, assimilation movement
		- simultaneously trying to bring these peoples together but also keep them separate
- What do you think of the ending? (this is what everybody said ofc bc i didnt read)
	- ending is bittersweet
	- does this resolve mr nams identity crisis
	- grounded, realistic picture
	- dont really like the ending
		- feels very optimistic
		- ends with haruo accepting hes half korean and walks into the sunset with mr minami
		- erases all the stuff that happens, in the story and historically
		- korean erasure, forgetting the conflicts that happened
	- get the impression that haruo has come to terms with his own identity
	- like the ending, was good in a lot of ways
		- about their korean identity, and thats what it wrapped up
		- their were other issues not resolved, but doesnt need to
		- real life issues not resolved, but they werent resolved in real life at that time
	- ending was emotional
- How would you summarize the story in a word/phrase
	- conflict
	- identity
	- problems
	- parental societal combo
		- haruo had to deal with both crises, both issues influenced each other
	- imperial minorities
	- internal struggle
	- internal manifestation of conflict
	- trauma

on thursday
usually a lecture but this time we have a essay to discuss on Into the Light
Christina Yi, "[[National Language, Imperialization, and the Gendered Aporia of Empire]]"
"slightly more difficult reading"

Questions for the reading
- Narrators name is Minami/Nam. What argument does the author make about the politics of these readings?
- What is the "hierarchy in the configuration of local imperial identity" (p. 824)?
- How does she critique Tokieda Motoki's theory on "national language"?
- How does she read *Into the Light* in relation to this theory
- What is the "gendered aporia of empire"?
