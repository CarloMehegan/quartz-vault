##### [[Master Dong's Western Chamber Romance]]
interpretation/adaptation of the [[Story of Ying-ying]]
form of the story is very different than anything we've seen
in the form of a play

##### Dong Jieyuan fl. 1189-1208
wrote the Western Chamber Romance
most popular version of western chamber romance written a few hundred years later but we arent gonna look at that
did well in provincial exams, seen in his pen name Jieyuan, an honorrific for people who graduated the exams or smth

lots of literature from this time lost/destroyed
plays would circulate among a few elite people
part of the prestige was being part of the group that could read those few copies
and the few copies were all lost bc they were gatekept

##### A Play in all Keys and Modes

genre of this play is _ which means A Play in all Keys and Modes
may also be called a medley
combination of poetry (sung) and prose (spoken out loud)
wouldve been all performed by a single actor portraying everyone
mix of classical/formal written language and vernacular conversation parts

##### Some things to think about
- most of the country non Han Chinese people, literature has different styles
- how literature would be experienced based on who you are, where you are, at the time
- how is reading this place different from seeing it performed in a crowded marketplace
	- many plays written as desk plays, meant to be read on your own
	- this play was likely written for performance
- very different portrayal of buddhism/monks/scholars/soldiers
- how does it keep audiences engage
- how is filial piety/other themes we've seen in class used
- how is it different from the story of ying ying

##### Only looking at 1 of 4 acts
- missing out on relationship between chang and ying ying
- fascinating bc based on a single paragraph of the story
	- "This year Hun Chen died in P'u ... mutiny ... escaped from harm"
distrust of eunuchs
- becoming a eunuch in order to gain power in the govt
- often very close to powerful people

##### discussion
- while based on story of ying ying, many details changed
	- has a happy ending, they get married at the end
	- battle at the beginning becomes a large part
	- the go between character becomes more important
- format is also different
	- story of ying ying: classical language tale
	- western chamber romance: mixed modes tale
- starts from perspective of a monk fearful of the mutiny
- different tones
	- rustic, gritty
	- its giving dynasty warriors 8 XL (i just started playing dynasty warriors 8 XL)
	- omg the horse is a red mare or something like strong horse whatever anyways the footnote says named after L'u Pu's horse is that Lu Bu? he has a crazy red horse in dynasty warriors
- poetry as proof
	- mentions the story of ying ying as proof these events occured
	- seen in this genre a lot
- "He thinks he can overthrow the Tang"
	- portrayed in og story as some local skirmish, here its a huge conflict
	- not supposed to think he could actually overthrow the dynasty probably but used for dramatic effect
- one monk, **Fa-ts'ung**, steps up from the back and says no we can fight
	- this monk had a rugged history but became a monk for salvation
	- many at the time believed that this is what monks were like, people who had criminal pasts and became monks to evade punishment
	- he thinks that if they can intimidate the people outside the gates they can get them to scatter because most are just there to follow the mutiny; no structure
	- he's bloodthirsty
	- its giving dynasty warriors 8 xl
	- wheres student chang anyways?
- "a full eight feet"
	- focus on character description
	- tendency towards "grotesque dimensions"
	- huge odd heroes
	- describes other monks as rugged but not as ferocious
	- describes the rebel chief guy and his troops similarly
- need to use wit to defeat the rebels
	- fatsung tries to reason with them
- fatsung berates them and starts fighting
- taunting
- skipping ahead a little
- common trope in these stories, "A clashing sound was heard. Was the monk dead?"
	- brief increase in tension
	- that part was prose, then goes into poetry, then we go back to the monk defending himself
- nothing can defeat fatsung
- fighting tension in these scenes similar to "sexual tension in other stories"
	- "weird thing to say but we'll see"
- lots more fighting
- ends up in a draw, decides to enact another plan
	- fatsung breaks through the lines
	- "Perhaps I shouldn't say this -- he's exactly like / A cock having just / Emerged from a cunt."
	- here we see the vulgarity part
- Flying Tiger Sun (the rebel chief guy) makes demands
- Fatsung is fleeing
- Flying Tiger Sun has big ideas, trying to gain resources to gain forces
- Madam Ts'ui hears about these demands and faints
- Ying-ying says dont worry about me I'll give myself up
	- filial piety
	- "You must not let others be harmed just so that i may be saved from shame"
- dont know what to do
- yingying decides she'll jump from the steps and give herself up when someone laughs and claps his hands
	- here comes the hero of the story
	- "A young scholar matchless in beauty"
	- Chang
	- clear he is unable to fight anyone, frail
	- says he can defeat them, has a plan
- in the midst we get an argument about Buddhism and Confucianism
	- life and death and karma and fate and stuff, what if we did something bad to these rebels in a past life and this is karma
	- our spirit is our true self our body is but a temporary abode
	- possessions must be left behind, its fine if the temple burns 
	- then start talking about Confucianism
	- charitable person loves humanity, would want to remove this threat
	- anyways he's stalling to give away his plan
- trying to get with ying ying leveraging his plan
	- "But when this is done, You mustn't start treating me like a stranger again"
- madam ts'ui says that she will see him as a son and he gives up his plan
	- gonna tell them that theyll give up ying ying
	- then Chung his gonna call in his connections to defeat the rebels
	- deus ex machina
	- he gives the letter to Fatsung (hed already given him the letter before he started fighting and broke through) and he gives the letter to the guy (this is next chapter also) and then the besties come in and quell the rebels and save them

thoughts
- the way monks are seen changes the reading
	- Chung calls them out as being basically the same as the people outside the walls
- the way Fatsung was portrayed seems more heroic than Chung
- what was the point of the religious argument that happened
	- hes making fun of them
- his plan is basically writing a nice email
- anticlimactic
	- adds to the humor of it
- masculinity presented differently, and in different ways
- ying ying's character in this adaptation
	- portrayed in negative light "almost mary sue"
	- very conflicted, reasonably, in a tough situation
	- being presented with no flaws
- liked how ying ying was presented in the og story better
	- makes her seem even worse here, passive 
	- she had a fairly reasonable plan for the situation and Chung waves it away as being emotional and monks think they will get in trouble
