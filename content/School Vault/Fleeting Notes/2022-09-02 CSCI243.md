how to study for this class
go to lecture
reread the notes after
read the book for extra explanations and examples
do the hw

from last time
- focusing on discrete structures bc we want something countable
- logic can be many things truth can have many ideas
- focusing on coherence, start with priniciples considered true (axioms)
- studying the logic that takes you from whatever you assume true to more truths


### Propositional and predicate logic
"gonna spend a couple weeks on this"
starting with proposition

What is a proposition? def.
	A proposition is a statement that has a truth value; either true (T) or false (F), but not both.
	p, q, r, s, t - symbols we will use for propositions

examples
	How much does it cost? = not a proposition
	This room is ugly = not a proposition, subjective
	The radius of the earth is 1km = a proposition, and a false one
	1 + 1 equals 2  = a proposition, true
	1 + 1 equals 3  = a proposition, false

what about?
	x + 1 equals 2  = not a proposition, could be true or false depending on x, has no truth value
predicate?

def.
	Logic dealing with propositions is called Propositional Calculus.

Compound propositions can be constructed using propositions and one or more logical operators.

##### Logical operators
Unary operator - takes only one argument/proposition
	¬ not - flips a proposition
	ɪ identity - leaves a proposition as is
these are the only operations that can be done with one prop.

Binary operator - takes two arguments
	∧ and - conjunction
	∨ or - disjunction
	⊕ exclusive-or - one has to be true, not both - "either-or"
	→ implication/conditional - if, then (ish, we'll come back to it)
	↔ equivalence/biconditional

##### Truth tables
not
![[Pasted image 20220902112014.png]]
only two options

and & or
![[Pasted image 20220902112147.png]]
4 possibilities
and needs both true
or needs at least one true

![[Pasted image 20220902112721.png]]
exclusive or needs exactly one true
to the right of the exclusive or column we can see two ways to represent the exclusive or with *not*, *and*, and *or*.
p ⊕ q ≡ (p∧ ¬q)∨(¬p∧q) ≡ (p∨q)∧(¬p∨ ¬q)
≡ means equivalent
this shows that are multiple, equivalent ways to write the same operation

we can use these methods to create formal proofs that prove, for example, that code will always work for all possible inputs

compound statements can become verbose
”Either the car is a Ferrari OR the car color is red”
≡ "the car is a ferrari and it is not red or the car is not a ferrari and it is red"
≡ "the car is a ferrari or the car is red and the car is not a ferrari or the car is not red"

order of operations is ¬,∧,∨,→,↔
parentheses can override this order

![[Pasted image 20220902114512.png]]
if falsehood gives rise to a falsehood, the implication is true (why?)
if falsehood gives rise to a truth, the implication is true (why?)
if a truth gives rise to a false, then it is not an implication
if a truth gives rise to a truth, then you have an implication

the first two lines dont make much english sense in terms of an if, then statement
ex. pythagorean theorem, if right triangle, then $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
if given right triangle (T), then get $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ (T)
if given not a right triangle (F), then get $a^2 + b^2 \neq c^2$ (F) the theorem is not wrong, just false input
.... look into this more???
cont on monday
