## Zainichi Koreans in Postwar Japan
wrapping up class with this final lesson
see how it ties to all the other modules we've done

today, Zainichi refers to foreign nationals living in japan
and particularly koreans
literal meaning is "living in japan"
usually refers to koreans living in japan
not all koreans are zainichi koreans
zainichi koreans 
- the ones who migrated to japan after colonial period
- second, third, generation
- the koreans whose ancestors migrated to korea

today talking about the zainichi korean community in japan

documentary [[Our School]] we are talking about next class is about koreans, and, looking at north koreans in japan specifically
very interesting situation, the students who have aligned themselves with north korea are allowed to travel there

##### Korean Residents in Japan after WWII
- Japan's colonization of Korea, 1910-1945
- Koreans in Japan
	- about 2 million by 1945
	- [[Into the Light]] takes place in Tokyo
- Japan's surrender, August 1945
	- Many Koreans return to the peninsula
	- number of koreans living in japan sharply dropped
	- but then, many of those who went back to the peninsula went back to japan after realizing they had lost their home
	- also, situation in korea was just as bad if not worse than japan; political unrest, division
- Question of nationality
	- Alien Registration Ordinance, May 2 1947 as a Potsdam order
	- Koreans classified as "aliens"
	- koreans lost their nationality
	- major difference from japanese americans; cant deprive anyone american nationality as long as they are born there
		- nisei were interned, treated unfairly, but retained american nationality
	- koreans living in japan after japan lost the colony had their japanese nationality revoked; no longer japanese
	- also this is happening to taiwan too dont forget
	- beginning of many problems zainichi koreans face even today
	- major difference between here and there; being born in japan doesnt grant nationality like it does in the us - need at least one parent to be japanese to be granted japanese nationality at birth
- Japanese Constitution becomes effective, May 3, 1947
- San Francisco Treaty, April 1952
	- ended war between japan and the US and britain
	- former colonial subjects officially lost their Japanese nationality
	- "Special permanent residents"
	- visa to stay in japan permanently, but not japanese

##### The Two Koreas: North and South
- Peninsula divided by USA and Soviet Union
	- most koreans going to japan came from southern part of peninsula
	- identification with north is not because of their place of origin, but political identification
- Cheju (Jeju) uprising, April 1948
	- Jeju island, now a resort island, part of Korea
	- many residents suspected as communists
	- anti communist South Korean forces killed sympathizers
	- representative of rising cold war tensions
	- not much industry on Jeju, many Koreans moved to Osaka for work
	- ferry line between Jeju and Osaka
- Republic of Korea, August 1948
	- south korea
	- supported by the US
	- Syngman Rhee, president
	- establishes diplomatic relations with Japan through Treaty of Basic Relations in 1965
		- took like 18 years
		- lots of anti japanese sentiment, opposition in korea to establishing relationship with japan
	- problems related to war reparations, japanese companies, still a diplomatic issue today, based on this treaty
- Democratic People's Republic of Korea, September 1948
	- north korea
	- supported by soviet union, communist regime, dictatorship
	- Kim Il-sung, dictator
	- no diplomatic relations with Japan
	- still no diplomatic relations today
	- japan recognizes only south korea
	- us doesnt have relationship with north korea either, but there are european countries that do
- Some Koreans move back to Japan
- Nationality of Koreans in Japan
	- "Korea" and "ROK"
	- complex issue
	- zainichi koreans lost japanese nationality
	- in terms of nationality, there are 3 categories
		- japanese nationality, can be earned, zainichi can naturalize and switch to japanese nationality
		- south korean nationality, republic of korea, still living in japan as south korean nationality
		- korean nationality; those who identify as north koreans can't identify themselves as such, because not recognized by japan, so only option is "korea", even though there is no country called Korea
	- problems for zainichi who identify as north korean
		- no nationality, not even a passport, even though youve lived in japan your whole life

##### Division within the Korean Community in Japan
- Korean Residents Union in Japan, or *Mindan*: for pro-ROK residents
- General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, or *Soren*: for pro-DPRK residents
	- "Mindan and the Soren, they hate each other!"
	- lot of tension between these two organizations
	- each have their own schools
	- many Mindan residents go to japanese schools, but Soren residents will go to their own Soren, North Korean schools
	- soren schools are not accredited schools in japan; cant go from soren high school to japanese university
	- in order to become eligible for japanese univesity, have to pass certain exams
- Cold War tension between the two Koreas transferred to Korean community in Japan
	- division was clear
- Koreans' "return" to North Korea
	- 1959-1984
	- under the support of Japanese gov and Red Cross
	- about 90,000 Sorens moved to North Korea
	- koreans going through harsh discrimination in japan, especially against soren koreans
	- discrimination in finding jobs, marriage, etc
	- moved to north korea, influenced by campaign to bring them there
	- campaign by north korea, promised better life in north korea,  supported by japan and the red cross
	- "return," because most of those koreans were from the southern part of the peninsula
	- most of them could not come back to japan ever again, detained in north korea
	- promised paradise was not there
