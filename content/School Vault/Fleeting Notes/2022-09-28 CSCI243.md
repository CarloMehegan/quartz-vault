description:: set operations and identities, trevtutor videos on sets

continuing sets and tuples


A subset of $A \times B$ is called **relation** from A to B (functions are special relations)

It is useful to restrict quantifiers to particular sets
ex $\forall x \in S(P(x))$
weve seen this before
$\exists x \in \mathbb{R} (Q(x))$
btw real number symbol is latex \\mathbb{R}

Truth Set of a predicate P(x) is defined as $\{ x \in \mathbb{R}|P(x) \}$
ex $x + 3 > 0$
true when $x > -3$
$\{ x > -3\}$


## Set operations
##### Union
$A \cup B = \{x|x \in A \vee x \in B\}$, $\bigcup^n_{i=1} A_i = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup ... \cup A_n$

##### Intersection
$A \cap B = \{x|x \in A \wedge x \in B\}$, $\bigcap^n_{i=1} A_i = A_1 \cap A_2 \cap ... \cap A_n$
![[Pasted image 20220928111447.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220928111550.png]]
if it was three circles connected like a chain, intersection of all three would be $\emptyset$ (cant find picture example)

A and B **disjoint** iff $A \cap B = \emptyset$.
$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$
"note that adding the cardinalities counts the elements of $A \cap B$ twice" ok so thats why we subtract the intersection

##### Difference
$A - B = \{x|x \in A \wedge x \notin B\}$
so, $|A - B| = |A| - |A \cap B|$

##### Complement
with respect to a universal set $U$: 
$\bar A = U - A = \{x|x \notin A\}$

## Set Identities
set identities are used to simplify or manipulate an expression that involves sets.

##### Identity Law
$A \cup \emptyset = A, A \cap U = A$

##### Domination Law
$A \cup U = U, A \cap \emptyset = \emptyset$

##### Idempotent Law
$A \cup A = A, A \cap A = A$

##### Complementation Law
$\bar {\bar {A}}$ = A
double complement

##### Absorption Law
$A \cup (A \cap B) = A, A \cap (A \cup B) = A$
![[Pasted image 20220928113436.png]]

##### Complement Law
$A \cup \bar A = U$
$A \cap \bar A = \emptyset$

##### Commutative Law
$A \cup B = B \cup A$
$A \cap B = B \cap A$

##### Associative Law
$A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C)$
$A \cap (B \cap C) = (A \cap B) \cap C)$

##### Distributive Law
$A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$
$A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$

##### De Morgan's Law
![[Pasted image 20220928113859.png]]
(bars wont display right in mathjax)

##### Membership table
one way used for proving equality of two set expressions
1s and 0s used to specify if an arbitrary element x is in a set expression or not
the rows in the table are all possible membership combinations of x
if the columns for two expressions are identical then the expressions are equal
![[Pasted image 20220928114317.png]]
this table proves de morgans

this is not the preferred way ; how do we generalize like with truth tables in propositional calculus?

ex.
$\bar {A \cup B} = \bar A \cap \bar A \leftrightarrow \bar {A \cup B} \subseteq \bar A \cap \bar B \wedge \bar A \cap \bar B \subseteq \bar A \cup \bar B$
pretend the bar goes all the way over $A \cup B$
algebraic proof:
i took a screenshot im not writing it all out end of class
![[A1C591F6-57BA-4570-94F7-36DB14036FE2.png]]More to this proof I think but this is where we left off

class over its 8pm but im gonna watch some videos about set theory and take notes

## Vid 1 - TrevTutor Intro to Set Theory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyDKR4FG3Yw

A set is a collection of objects, called **elements**
the curly bracket notation is called **list notation**
sets can be finite or infinite

special sets, like all real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ or integers $\mathbb{Z}$ or natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ or rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$

sets have no order
repeated elements are only listed once
$\{a,b,a,c,b,a\} = \{a,b,c\} = \{c, b, a\}$

ex.
let $C = \{yellow, blue, red\}$

"yellow is an element of C"
- element yellow is inside set C
- $yellow \in C$

"green is not in C"
- $green \notin C$

"the cardinality of C is 3"
- **cardinality means size**
- $|C| = 3$


the empty set
- $\emptyset$ = $\{\}$
only set with size of 0
- $|\emptyset | = 0$
the size of the set containing the empty set is 1
- $|\{ \emptyset \} | = 1$
- sets can have sets as elements

![[Pasted image 20220928202105.png]]

Set-Builder Notation

define elements as variables
![[Pasted image 20220928202159.png]]
= $\{ \frac m n | m, n \in \mathbb{Z} , n \neq 0 \}$

another ex. set of even numbers
= $\{ 2n | n \in \mathbb{Z} \}$


## Vid 2 - TrevTutor Cartesian Products and Ordered Pairs

given X = {0,1,2} and Y = {0, 1}
**Cartesian product** of X and Y, denoted $X \times Y$, is the set of all ordered pairs from X and Y.
Note that $X \times Y \neq Y \times X$.

could call $X \times Y$ "X times Y" or "X cross Y"

$X \times Y$ = { (0,0) , (0,1) , (1,0) , (1,1) , (2,0) , (2,1) }
$Y \times X$ = { (0,0) , (0,1) , (0,2) , (1,0) , (1,1) , (1,2) }

What is the cardinality of $A \times B$ ?
If $|A| = m$ and $|B| = n$
$|A \times B| = mn$
or
$|A| \cdot |B| = |A \times B|$

ex. A is size 3 and B is size 2, then size of $A \times B$ is 6

Cartesian Products can generalize to **n-tuples**

we could do 3 sets $A \times B \times C$
$= \{(a,b,c) | a \in A, b \in B, c \in C\}$
we could do $n$ sets $A_1 \times A_2 \times ... \times A_n$
$= \{(a_1,a_2,...,a_n) | a_1 \in A_1, a_2 \in A_2, ... , a_n \in A_n\}$

also $A \times \emptyset = \emptyset$


## Vid 3 - TrevTutor Subsets and Power Sets

Subsets
If A is a subset of B, then **every element in A must also be in B**.

$A \subseteq B$
A could be contained within B, or A could be exactly the same elements as B. This equivalence is denoted by the line in the symbol $\subseteq$. A proper subset is denoted by $\subset$.

examples

{a,b} $\subseteq$ {a,b,c} ?
- yes

{c,d} $\subseteq$ {c,d} ?
- yes

{a} $\subseteq$ {{a}} ?
- no!
- the elements on the left are: a
- the elements on the right are: {a}
- not the same

$\emptyset$ $\subseteq$ {x,y,z} ?
- yes!
- **the empty set is a subset of every set**
- "trivially true"


A **Power Set** of A, p(A), is the set containing **all possible subsets of A**.

how do we generate all possible subsets?
given A = {a,b}:
![[Pasted image 20220928205239.png]]
think of a tree
above tree shows how to generate all possible subsets
(not viable to write out every time)

here we see p(A) = { $\emptyset$, {a}, {b}, {a,b} }

if size of A = n, then size of p(A) = $2^{|A|} = 2^n$
2 choices per element, to add it or not

ex, if $|A| = 6$, then $|p(A)| = 2^6$

tricky questions
$p(\emptyset)$ ?
- $= \{\emptyset \}$

$p(\{\emptyset\})$ ?
- $= \{ \emptyset , \{ \emptyset \} \}$

is $A \subseteq p(A)$ for any $A$ ?
- no

is $A \in p(A)$ for any $A$ ?
- yes

think of tree from earlier
A = {a,b}
we see that {a,b} is an element of the powerset
so, $A \in p(A)$ for any A

however, the elements of A are a,b
and the elements of p(A) are $\emptyset$, {a}, {b}, {a,b}
we see that a and b are not elements of p(A)
so, A is not a subset of p(A) for any A
