interesting chapter we read today (i didnt read it ops)  
  
monday remote class on zoom we'll be discussing all the material weve covered in class  
4th essay due friday "but if you need extra time not an issue at all, turn it in when you can"  
interesting!  
  
text is very telling of a lot of late imperial chinese culture  
think about, what does this text tell us about china?

the monkey and the monk - abridged version of anthony whatevers translation

just last year or so a new translation by julia lovell - monkey king

use these versions in the next part talking about other parts of the book we didnt read

##### The rest of the novel
- depictions of heaven
	- secondary characters all go through a fall that leads to them having to help the monk in his travels
		- sun wukong the monkey king attracts the attention of heaven
		- shows a representation of what heaven looks like
	- see a scene in the book of a remonstration in heaven similar to the  way the emperor would address the complaints of people 
		- written in style called a memorial 
		- emperor would respond saying what theyd do about this
		- this process shows up in the novel as how minor dieties go to the empire in heaven to complain about this monkey wreaking havoc
		- buddhist flavor
		- part of the justice making process of imperial china
		- move from vernacular prose to highly memorialized language in the book, very striking when reading, evokes a high level of authority
	- multiple memorials come to the emperor about sun wukong
		- next one is more informational, littany about sun wukong and talks about how hes struck all monkeys names from the underworlds registry to make them immortal
	- instead of sending an army after him, emperor sends out for sun wukong to have a conversation with him
		- plan is appeasement, give him a rank and bring him in so hes satisfied
		- they try to pacify him and give him basically the job of heavenly stableboy taking care of horses and hes happy about it but he realizes this is one of the lowest ranks and revolts then they give him a higher rank and it keeps going
		- eventually buddha comes in to intercede
		- shows that the buddha is above the emperor
		- he cant beat buddha hes imprisoned under a mountain end of the first part of the novel ~first 7 chapters out of ~100
- tripitaka/the monk
	- difference between the real monk that sought the texts himself basically snuck out of the country and the monk in the novel who was actively sent out by the emperor
	- depending on where the monk goes hes welcomed as a representative of the great tang and in other places thats ignored
	- says a lot about ideas of the power of the dynasty; ming dynasty ideas of the cultural power of the tang dynasty
	- in the imperial period when something happens is super important; emperors duty to find that things accord with the calendar - monk should be sent out on an auspicious day
	- what do you think of these differences to the irl story? how would it change the story if tripitaka snuck out to make this journey?
		- dangerous at that time to write something ab going agianst the emperor
		- this version makes him seem more honorable righteous etc for being sent by the emperor
		- this version legitimizes his goal, sets him as a goody two shoes thats never done anything wrong
		- heaven is sanctioning his travels with giving him aid through his companions like sun wukong, if the emperor and the heavens have conflicting goals then thats dangerous to write about, would say something different ab the power of the emperor, divine right

##### Discussing the reading
- initial thoughts?
	- little more humorous than last class' reading
	- odd, off the wall
	- funny
	- monkey is very entertaining
	- reminiscent of (another story) uses a foreign land to show an unusal role for women
- tension between the narrative and sex
	- the monk can be corrupted, rip away the purity he has
	- monk is given problems that typically faced by women, feminization of the character, needs to be saved
- interesting narrative/conflict
	- if theres a country of only women how can there be babies born
	- theres a spring you drink from that makes you pregnant when you drink it
	- monkey gets sent off on a mission to find the opposite abortion water to fix some conflict in the plot
	- monkey traversing the universe the spring he has to go to is 3000 miles away very warped perspective of space
	- and warped perspective of time
	- shows how the journey is more important than the destination, the conflicts they go through is the important part
	- we know historically that this trip took 16 years
- thoughts during this time period on birth and abortion
	- not necessarily seen as super negative
	- seen practically 
	- birth control seen as something difficult to do anyways

##### Where does the novel go from here
- many arcs like this
- novel has to figure out how to wrap up all these loose ends and bring them back to china
- relationship to numerology, important part of the structure of the work
	- they have to go through a number of ordeals, which explains why sun wukong cant just jump around everywhere and get it done in a day
	- towards end of the book chapter 99 theres a discussion of all the different things tripitaka has gone through
	- starts with before he is born talks about his entire life
	- listed as ordeals
	- hes undergone 80 ordeals
	- this is a problem because 80 is not 9 times 9!
	- feels a little like breaking thr fourth wall
	- anyways cant just escort him back to china needs one more ordeal
	- ends up falling into an ocean, rescued by enormous turtle from an earlier chapter conflict with the turtle anyways thats the 81st ordeal
	- all the sutras gets dropped in the water and are damaged in the drying process, explaining why some sutras irl are damaged
- getting their rewards
	- all the characters made different dieties
	- karmic reward bestowed upon them

##### The book's impacts
- the contents of the book has been very influential and used over and over
	- like greek mythology
	- structure not as important, was alrdy well established, the contents are whats important
- how does this novel compare to novels today?
	- much more episodic
		- did circulate at its time as separate chapters
	- jokes are pretty crude
	- feels less bound as logic
		- theres usually rules and stuff like rules of magic systems
		- seems to be throwing stuff out there
	- goes beyond just monster of the day, monsters have moral backgrounds to them, daoist influence, like how the land of only women was used to explore concept of lust
- other ways we can think of this novel
	- representations of religion, buddhism, daoism
	- representations of women
- many sequels that came out almost immediately
- video games that take from this novel
	- date back to early console games
	- Black Myth: Wukong is the next upcoming one
	- theres a lot!
	- the structure of the story contributes to its ability to be turned into a game
- Lego Monkie Kid 
- wow theres a lot3333
