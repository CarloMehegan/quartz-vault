description:: factorials, sequences

last time ended talking about logarithms
test on friday
26 questions?
open book open note offline
test on paper
ugh i have to go to class irl
"please practice algrebra guys"
ok sounds like i should practice algebra...
i guess i have to learn how logs work

##### Factorials
$n! = \Pi ^n_{i=1} i$

Stirling's approximation
$n! = \sqrt {2 \pi n} (\frac n e)^n (1+ \Theta (\frac 1 n))$

$\Theta$ means having the same order of magnitude
complexity stuff
"we'll use theta a lot starting next week"

$logn! = \sum^n_{i=1} logi \leq n log n$
We'll see later it is $\Theta(n log n)$

##### $log^*$
$log^*n = min\{i \geq 0: log^{(i)} n \leq 1 \}$
$log^{(i)} n = log(log(log(log(...logn))))...)$
	log applied $i$ times

$log^* 2 = 1$
$log^* 4 = 2$
	$log 4 = 2$
$log^* 8 = 3$
	$log 8 = 3$
	$log 3 \leq 2$
	$log(log3) \leq 1$
$log^* 16 = 4$
	$log 16 = 4$
	$log 4 = 2$
	$log 2 = 1$
whats the first number where $log^*$ is 4?
17, because theres 3 steps to get to 1 from 16
$log^*$ is asking how many times you have to 

last number where $log^*$ is 4
$log^*65536 = 4 = log^*2^{16}$
this shows that log grows very slowly, esp in terms of complexity

## Sequences and Sums
A **sequence** is a discrete structure used to represent an ordered list. It can be defined as a function $s : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow S$, for some set $S$.

examples
- $a_1 =$ employee #1, ..., $a_i =$ employee #$i$
- think array, but not necessarily finite
- $\{h_n\}$, where $h_n = \frac 1 n$, is the **harmonic series** $1, \frac 1 2, \frac 1 3,...$
- in some cases, a sequence may also start from $n = 0$
- **Arithmetic progression** $a, a+d, a + 2d, a + 3d, ... , a +nd,...$
	- these terms are described using $a_0, a_1, a_2, ...$ etc.
	- or $p_1, p_2, p_3, ...$
		- $p_i = a + (i-1)d$
- **Geometric progression** $a, ar, ar^2, ... , ar^n, ...$
	- or $g_0, g_1, g_2, ...$
		- $g_i = ar^i$
- $1,2,3,4,5,...$
	- arithmetic adding 1
- $2,4,6,8,...$
	- arithmetic adding 2
- $1,2,4,8,16,...$
	- geometric with factor $r = 2$
- $1, \frac 1 2, \frac 1 4, \frac 1 8, ...$
	- geometric with factor $r = \frac 1 2$
- $1, 0.8, 0.64, 0.512, 0.4096, ...$
	- geometric with factor?... $r = 0.8$
- **Perfect Squares** $1, 4, 9, 16, 25,...$
	- $a_i = i^2$
- **Fibonacci** $1,1,2,3,5,8,13...$
	- $f_i = f_{i-2} + f_{i-1}$
	- very important detail - need to specify starting conditions
	- $f_1 = 1, f_2 = 1$
