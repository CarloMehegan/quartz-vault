##### From Ryūkyū Kingdom to Okinawa Prefecture
- Ryukyu kingdom
	- Vassal state of the Satsuma domain during the Tokugawa era (1603-1868)
	- Japan was divided into many different domains in Tokugawa Japan; Satsuma domain was the southmost
	- Satsuma domain invaded Ryukyu kingdom; vassal relationship between the two
- Also sent tribute to Qing China (within China's tributary system)
	- last chinese dynasty
	- tributary system 
		- international system that existed in premodern asia
		- created by the chinese empire
		- other countries required to send tribute to china, and receive protection from china in exchange
		- korea, ryukyu kingdom, part of the system
			- had autonomy for domestic politics, but diplomatically no control in politics, controlled by chinese empire
		- japan wasnt part of it
- Meiji Restoration, 1868
	- Ryukyu incorporated into Japan as Okinawa prefecture, 1879
- Considered culturally "backward"
	- assimilation policy enforced by Tokyo government (i.e., language, customs)
	- had their own dialect, not intelligible with japanese
	- strict assimilation policy, forced Okinawa to learn japanese
	- there were many dialects in japan, Meiji govt worked to create an artificial standard japanese and spread that through the country
	- shows how japan changed; unified language wasnt needed before, very rural country, everyone stayed in their village and didnt travel much
- Integrated into the national economy
	- Monoculture within national economy: sugar cane
	- when ryukyu kingdom was independent, had its own economy
	- after assimilation, given a specific role in the broader system
	- cant grow sugar cane in the rest of japan because it's too cold

##### Battle of Okinawa
- Naha destroyed by American air raids, October 1944
	- Naha is the capital city of Okinawa
- American land invasion of the main island, April 1945
	- only place in japan where land invasion took place
- "Group suicide" (e.g. Chibichrigama, 1945)
	- tensions rose between Okinawa and mainland Japan
	- okinawans seen as spies for americans because they spoke their own language
	- japanese military officers became paranoid of okinawans
	- banned from surrendering by japanese military, had to kill themselves
	- forced directly or indirectly by the japanese military
	- civillians
	- Chibichrigama - cave in mountains where many civillians were hiding, where group suicide took place, encouraged by japanese military personnel
	- Japanese military personnel didnt act this way in mainland, only towards Okinawans
	- a lot has been written about this after the war
	- survivors spreading their stories starting in ~1970s - many people didnt want to speak of the war before that
- Execution of Okinawans by Japanese soldiers (e.g. Kumejima massacre)
	- Long history of discrimination against Okinawans
	- many korean civillians migrated, now living in okinawa; part of the reason for discrimination
- End of battle, June 23 1945
	- and american occupation started

Battle of Okinawa

##### US Occupation, 1945-1972
- US Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands
	- military govt established by us
	- different from occupation of japan, didnt establish a military govt there
- Americans first viewed as liberators from Japanese oppression
	- bad relationship with japanese military
- Korean War 1950
	- Okinawa's strategic importance increases
- San Francisco Peace Treaty, 1951
	- signed between japan and the us
	- terminates US occupation of Japan
	- confirms US control over Okinawa
	- detached Okinawa from Japanese sovereignty
	- gave independence and sovereignty to japan, but not okinawa
- Government of the Ryukyu Islands
	- civillian govt
	- members popularly elected
	- on top of this govt, controlled by the US Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands
	- colonial relationship
	- Limited democracy nuder UC occupation

Okinawan resistance/responses to American occupation

##### Resistance and Support
- Expropriation of land by US forces
- Price Report 1956
	- Melvin Price
	- provided suggestions for resolution of problems the us faces
	- "...the US would acquire long-term interests in the lands required by the United States forces. In the light of the strong Ryukyuan tradition against relinquishing title to land, the program contemplated is the acquisition of long-term easements granting full use of the land for so long as it may be needed by the US, with lump-sum payment to be made to the owner..."
	- take okinawan land (to be returned at some point) and pay the owners a lump sum
	- unfair bc they didnt know how long they were relinquishing ownership for, wanted annual payment, not lump sum
- Vietnam War in 1960s
	- bases in Okinawa heavily used
	- US presence became more prominent
- Crimes by US soldiers, more than 1000 a year, 1965
	- anti US-movement intensifies
	- okinawa/japanese law doesnt apply to the us soldiers on bases, cant be punished; legal inequality
- Support for the US military from businesses targeting the US military
	- no major industry for Okinawa
	- americans were important customers
	- tourist industry basically
	- bars, nightclubs, restaurants, entertainment
	- can see the same things happening today around military bases

Koza Uprising, December 1970

##### Okinawa's Reversion
- US in the 1960s
	- Vietnam War at stalemate
	- Anti-war and civil rights movements at home
	- Anti-war and anti-US movements in Japan
- Nixon agrees to return Okinawa to Japanese sovereignty 1969
	- majority of okinawans wanted to return to japanese sovereignty and escape us occupation
- Reversion, 1972
	- Okinawa "sold" for $320 million
	- "not unique"; when colonies gain independence, colonizers demanded some kind of money because they had clearly built infrastructure there
- US military remained
	- agreement between the US and Japanese governments
- 15% of total land of Okinawa (20% of main island) occupied by the US military
- Anti-base movement continues to this day
	- critical of the fact US bases were unevenly distributed throughout Japan; many in Okinawa and other prefectures, but some prefectures have none at all, like Osaka prefecture

##### Higashi Mineo 1938-present
- Born in Mindanao, Philippines (OMG!)
- Repatriated to Japan, 1945
- Moved to Okinawa, 1946
- Moved to Tokyo, 1964
- *Okinawa no Shonen*, tr. *Boy of Okinawa* or *Child of Okinawa*
	- [[Child of Okinawa]] won Akutagawa Prize, 1971
	- didnt write much after, some short stories, stopped writing after 1980
	- has started appearing in the media again in the last 15 years or so
- Issues to consider
	- Narratives of American presence
		- he interacts with many soldiers through his parents business
	- Relations between the Japanese and the Americans; and among the Japanese
	- Images of Okinawa that the novel creates
		- what image do readers in japan have about okinawa
		- "this story offers a very specific image of okinawa"
	- Comparison to the two previous readings
		- [[The Only Woman in the Room]]
		- [[Beyond Vietnam]]
		- all stories about american occupation/presence in japan/asia
