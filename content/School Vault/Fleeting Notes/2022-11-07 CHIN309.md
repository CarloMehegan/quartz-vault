description:: discussing [[Wu Sung Beats the Tiger]]

talking ab an excerpt from a novel
written in the very early Ming Dynasty
"novel was a genre that came into its own in the ming dynasty and didnt really exist prior to that"

Ming Dynasty 1368-1644
Between Yuan and Qing dynasties

##### (Chaptered) Novels
- read mostly for pleasure
- considered vulgar, written in vernacular chinese, authors often used pseudonyms
- romance of the three kingdoms written around this time
- central characteristic - every chapter will begin with a couplet
	- end with some form of formulaic phrase "to see what happens next read the next chapter"
- standard convention for a narrative figure to interject
- by 1770-1780s when the dream of the red chamber comes out, novels are more respected

##### The Water Margin
- or Outlaws of the March
- or All Men are Brothers
- One of the Four Great Classical Novels
	- other three are Journey to the West, Dream of the Red Chamber, and Romance of the Three Kingdoms
- many versions of the book, many accepted as worth reading
	- in one version the bandits are granted amnesty
	- in one version the character dreams they are all executed at the end (we are reading this one)
	- etc
	- why does the editor of our particular version decide to change the ending?
- Shi Nai'an 1296?-1372?
	- largely attributed with creating the water margin
	- may have edited it
- 108 Bandits
	- 36 Heavenly Spirits, 72 Earthly Demons
	- novel goes over these with varying significance
	- 36 heavenly spirits are the main characters
- Character driven and Episodic
	- many characters
	- almost no discussion of romance, unlike many of the novels written at the time
	- constructed of a bunch of small stories
	- we get the backstories of all these different people
- Bi-partite structure
	- split into two parts
	- first ab the backstories and stuf
	- second part they are pardoned and fight for the govt
	- second part is usually less popular
- Wu Song
	- one of the most influential characters
	- The Water Margin becomes very influential in Japan
	- spurred a number of rewrites
	- A scandalous rewrite
		- The Plum and the Golden Vase
		- a pornographic satire of society in the ming dynasty
		- takes part of the story of Wu song and turns it into a whole novel
		- shows how people find this text interesting and rewrite it
- Illustrated Editions
	- people love looking at pictures!
	- certain editions illustrations become popular as trading cards
- Jin Shengtan and the goals of fiction
	- or: Are the Bandits "Loyal and Righteous?"
	- Jin Shengtan was a famous scholar at the end of ming dynasty(?~)
	- offered annotated versions of famous works
	- thinks that the water margin is one of the best novels ever written
	- true authorship is something that can only be done by sages and the emperor
	- in his edited version, he takes out the words Loyal and Righteous
	- cant call these characters righteous because they are murderers and plunderers
	- takes away the happy ending where they are forgiven
	- we are reading the version with his commentary

##### [[Wu Sung Beats the Tiger]]
- "not set up with the narrative logic we'd expect today"
- wu sung is gonna go visit his brothers and he has to 
- "{Club: the fifth time}"
	- first of Jin Shengtan's comments
	- he wants us to pay attention to when the author mentions his club; why is this?
- everything is spoiled it says like in 4 different places on this page that wu sung is gonna fight a tiger
	- the important part isnt the surprise, it's about enjoying and understanding How the story is told
- fascinating to see what jin shengtan thinks
	- shows us what is important to this figure from this time in the past
	- not all of the annotations are transformative or add much but still pretty interesting/funny
	- these notes were inserted directly into the text between sentences
- "Then we see the shop owner bring three bowls {Extraordinary writing.}, ..."
	- whys that extraordinary writing
	- prob drawing attention to the use of counting
	- also said it was extraordinary earlier when the sign said no more than three bowls
	- No Crossing After Three Bowls
	- interesting how he emphasizes certain seemingly mundane parts
- "{Ordinary folks are not worth mentioning}"
- "{The author switches to another way of writing. I cannot help but roar in laughter reading this}"
	- switches from more flowery prose to more dialogue focused
- govt delegates the killing of the loose tiger to local hunters with punishment of flogging if they dont
	- satire on how ming govt cant control anything, cant even hunt down this tiger
- wu sung is literate enough to be able to read the sign warning of tiger
	- sign says almost verbatim what the barkeep said to him
		- "{Extraordinary writing.}"
- then he comes to a temple and finds another sign about this tiger
	- "{Extraordinary writing.}"
- doesnt specify precise year/date this is happening, "such a day in such a month of such a year"
	- sometime in the early part of 12th century
- starts to believe there really is a tiger and maybe he's making a mistake
- starts to think he should go back to the wine shop
	- {"with this sign of weakness, wu sungs valor is brought out even more clearly"}
	- fears ridicule/being looked down upon and decides to keep going
- keeps going
- he starts feeling real drunk and finds a nice rock to take a nap, and then the tiger jumps out! the reader is frightened to death!
- he grabs his club and now they will face off
- jin shengtan's commentary adds to slowing down the narrative and adding suspense
	- extremely long comment before the fight adds suspense
	- very interesting way to change this reading
	- hes just saying wow youd never see a tiger fight a man in real life
	- Shi Nai'an has so embodied the nature of a tiger that in writing about one has become one
- this fight is so enthralling that jin shengtan sees a green bean (real)
- tigers cant see well behind them and wu sung has a one up on him
- wu sung is dodging the tiger is roaring
- he swings for the tiger and misses and breaks his club!!!! all those mentions of a club lead up to this
- "{We are absolutely stunned and can hardly dare read on... the reader is so frightened that his heart and liver have jumped out of his mouth.}"
- he wrestles with it and pummels it until the tiger eventually dies
- wu sung decides to take the tiger and drag it down the ridge but he cant because hes so tired
- he rests then realizes what if another tiger shows up so he will leave and then come back
- two more tigers come out! "{Extraordinary writing that will frighten people to death}"
- its just two hunters dressed as tigers
- we get more detail from these hunters the tribulations that the locals have gone through to try and kill this tiger
- wu sung shows them the dead tiger and its craaazy hes craaazy!
- after this wu sung is welcomed as a hero and stuff but the excerpt ends here

thoughts
- feels like a screenplay
	- descriptive in a way that it feels like you can picture whats happening
	- story beats feel like a play
	- elements are set up and used
	- many of these stories circulated orally prior to being written down  which may contribute to that feeling
- violence
	- not much besides when hes pummeling the tiger
	- this is one of the more tame stories in the book
- the commentary
	- interesting
	- adds to the story



next time discussing a scene from the dream of the red chamber
"very different from this"
