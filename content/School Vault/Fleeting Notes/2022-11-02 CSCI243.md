description:: even more complexity analysis

tired
if theres a gas leak at muscarelle area can i skip my math class

he wrapped up whatever example thing we ended last class with
anyways

##### Complexity for nested loops
A loop runs through a certain number of times which corresponds to summing whatever ops each iteration performs. So, a loop
```
for i=1 to n
	methodA(i)
	methodB(i)
```
takes time $\sum^n_{i=1}$ ( Ops(methodA(i)) + Ops(methodB(i)) )

Each of these methods could be a nested loop too. Every time we see a loop we nest a summation:
```
for i=1 to n
	for j=1 to i
		methodA(j)
```
takes time $\sum^n_{i=1}\sum^n_{j=1}$ Ops(methodA(j))

**While loops need to be examined carefully** to see how many times they execute and how their variable changes.
```
for i=1 to n
	j=i
	while j >= 1
		for l=1:j
			A(l)++
		j=j/2
```
takes time $\sum^n_{i=1}\sum^{logi}_{k=0}\sum^{i/2^k}_{1} 1$
first sum is from i to n, next is from 0 to log i, next is from 1 to $\frac i {2^k}$
i to n makes sense bc regular for loop
why 0 to log i for the while loop?
	"while loop will go 1 2 4 8 16 32 64..."
	i mean if you say so
	j = 1 2 4 8...
	k = 1 2 3 4...
	bump this up
	k = 0 1 2 3...
	ok there $j = 2^k$
	no this is for the third sum
	uhhh


anyways it comes out to $\Theta (n^2)$




ex i = 1 to n incrementing by 2 (odd numbers)
`i = odd = 2j - 1`
1. change of variable (seen above, j)
2. find the bounds of the new variable
$1 \leq j \leq n$
$1 \leq 2j-1 \leq n$
$1 \leq j \leq \frac {n+1} 2$
