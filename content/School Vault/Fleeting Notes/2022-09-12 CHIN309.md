description:: catch up from last time, discussing [[Dao De Jing]]

doing the online lecture now before class

##### A brief timeline of early China
Begins with Xia (Hsia) Dynasty
- prehistoric
- cs. 2100 - 1600 BC
  
Shang Dynasty
- everything we're looking at today
- ok so we did have a reading?

Is what we are looking at today "literature?"

##### Oracle Bone Inscriptions
- inscriptions on pieces of bone, size of a sheet of paper
- from cow or oxen bones and turtle shells
- used by diviners
- they determine cracks in the bone, then the results are inscribed into the bone
- central China Yingxiu
- preservation attempts - 3D models
- A Late Shang Divination Record
	- in the reading (LOL)
	- Crack-making
	- used to predict birth of a baby
	- the birth was not "good"; baby was a girl

##### The Sexagenary Cycle
for tracking dates
The Ten Heavenly Stems
- comes from ten suns in the sky, mythology
Twelve Earthly Branches
- Chinese Zodiac, rat ox tiger, etc

Combine these to form 60 bigrams
Used to discuss time

##### Bronze Inscriptions
in reading, Columbia pg 4-5
- story about a war

##### Script Development
how characters changed over time
more pictorial at first, became more abstract, simple, more straight lines

##### The Yi Jing
Book of Changes

used as a divination manual - later a philosophical text
"really a simple short concise text"
made up of 8 trigrams $\equiv$ different symbols
yang = unbroken lines
yin = broken lines
8 trigrams come together to form 64 hexagrams
if a divination process results in one, the yi jing is a reference for them

book of changes pg 5-7 from the reading (LOL)
- "note how esoteric, terse this is"
	- "a submerged dragon"
	- "nobles throughout the day"
	- "see a group of dragons without heads: auspicious"
- "not necessarily easy to understand as a reader, modern or contemporary"
- very vague guidances, have produced a lot of interpretation
some people have associated this book with the oracle bones, but used in other ways, other ways these hexagrams are generated

he said "check out this youtube video for more info" but i cant find the link

##### The Book of Documents
known as one of the five confucian classics
lays the way for confucian thought
confucius was ostensibly the original compiler of this text, not clear if he really did
one of the earliest collections of "literary material"

record of events and speeches
split into 4 parts
- 1st focused on __ the great
- xia dynasty
- shang dynasty
- jo dynasty

focused on an "old vs new" controversy
around 220 bc, emperor espoused legalism, demanded books not according to this be burned
scholars of the time tried to rewrite what was lost from memory, called the new texts
original copies were found (hidden in confucius' estate), now called the old texts
lot of arguments over which of these are more valid than the others

oldest prose in chinese known history

Tsinghua bamboo strips
An illustration of Emperor Yao from The Imperially Commissioned Pictorial Book Of Documents, 1902
The Councils of Kao-Yao
- framed as a conversation between __ the great, who became the king after developing a flood control plan to control the rivers, was given the throne, Shun(?) was passed the throne from Yao(?)
- he reads a excerpt im not gonna write it out but very philosophical "what makes a man virtuous" laid out dualistically, opposing characteristics in pairs

##### The Book/Classic of Odes/Songs
"will spend more time talking about this because I cant teach this class without talking about this"
the oldest collection of poetry from China
oldest thing that might be considered truly "literature"
305 poems originally accompanied with music 9th to 7th centuries bc, 200 year span
people tend to read these politically and historically in the early days, today might think of these more abstractly
later scholars tend to think of these as literary and less political

split into parts
- Airs of the States
	- 160 poems
	- mostly folk songs
	- seen as a reflection on common culture
- Lesser Ya
	- court hymns, ritual songs
- Greater Ya
	- court hymns, ritual songs
- Temple Hymns (Eulogies)
	- performed as part of sacrifical rites

first poem - The Ospreys
- organized in stanzas, rhymes (in Chinese)
- two parallel narratives in this poem
	- one related to people, one related to nature
- confucius talks about this particular poem in the Analects
	- "joy without wantoness, sorrow without self-injury"
	- "desire to moralize all literature, very confucian thing"
- can be read as criticism of a contemporary king that is not behaving properly
- can be read as praise of a specific king/queen
reconstructed pronunciation vs modern mandarin pronunciation, fascinating difference, we will look at later
Legge vs. Pound - different English translations of the poem
- Pound's translation is very different, we'll talk about this in class
- Pound didn't actually read Chinese
- discussion on him later


end of video
so what readings do i need to do?
- Columbia pp. 3-11 : divinations and inscriptions
- Columbia pp. 61-73 : classics of poetry and documents

and then it says for sept 12. need to read
- Lao Tzu - Dao De Jing chapters 1 - 20


---

in class notes 9/12
starting by going back through the slides from the online lecture video

##### A brief timeline of early China
![[Timeline of Chinese Dynasties.png]]

##### Oracle bone inscriptions
is this literature? some people will say no
does "literature" need to have artistic intent?

##### The Book of Documents
a good example of collections of essays that provide guidance to people
"artistic intent?"
Confucius

tsinghua bamboo slips
- excavated in China
- the evidence of these documents

new text tradition vs. old text tradition
- burning books
- Qin Dynasty. (221â€“206 BC) was based on legalism, competing books were burned
- after Qin dynasty, philosophers/historians/officials wrote down what they remember of the books, this is what was used for a long time
- later, copies of the original books were discovered in Confucius' estate, hidden
- so which texts are used now?
- "talk about this later, this is jumping ahead"

##### The book of odes
earliest poetry we have
4 sections
- folk poetry, largest portion
- court hymns, "lesser and greater"
- eulogies

consists of 4-syllable rhyming lines
when we read these, we often read them in modern dialects
the way they would have been pronounced when they were written is significantly different
ex. first poem, the ospreys (idk if both videos are of this poem)
https://youtu.be/kKQcFFhWSYo here is what the original might have sounded like
https://youtu.be/saUqqJ2nhIQ a the ospreys in modern dialect
these poems were accompanied by music, mostly if not completely lost now
translation - many differences in how these poems are translated

will see more translation issues today with the dao de jing


## Lao Tzu's [[Dao De Jing]]
very complex, hard to understand
lots of interpretations over time, which add to the "mythos" of it

called the Lao Tzu - who these works are often associated with
or the Dao De Jing - could translate to "The Book of the Way and of Virtue"

rhymes

people believed the "sage" Lao Tzu lived ~50yr before Confucius
im getting major Way of Kings vibes tbh is that wrong

the story goes that Confucius sought Lao Tzu's advice on how to properly conduct the rites
what he supposedly told Confucius

#quote "What you are talking about concerns merely the words left by people who have rotted along with their bones. . . . Rid yourself of your arrogance and your lustfulness, your ingratiating manners and your excessive ambition. These are all detrimental to your person. This is all I have to say to you."

Confucius had a response - didnt catch it - expression of gratitude to Lao Tzu as a wise figure


at a certain point Lao Tzu decides he will leave civilization - stuff sux
how do we survive in this tumultous world?
he leaves through the Han valley pass
the keeper of the pass asks him to write down his ideas - wrote the Dao De Jing - left civilization on an ox - according to the legend!

Daoism

there are a lot of reimaginings of what the meeting of confucius and lao tzu must have been like
ok hes sayin a lot of quotes and not putting them on the slides also saying a lot of names and not spelling them on the slides tbh! great quotes wish i could keep them here

the lao tzu confucius talked to could be a different lao tzu - cant really know, lots of contradictions, lack of information

philosophical flourishing - why we are starting here - many important texts start in this time frame

the central ideas of the lao tzu
- the Dao
	- it is not possible to fully understand the Dao
	- there are no words to express it fully
	- "the way"
	- its indescribable, like uhhh yeah
	- political actors need to act in accordance with the Dao
	- replaces the concept of heaven
- Virtue / De
	- not a super critical part
	- "more of a structural coincidence"
	- what does something take away from the Dao?
	- what does the Dao imbue in things?
	- these are virtuous
- Inaction
	- not doing anything outside of the Dao
	- acting at the proper time at the spur of the moment
	- "follow along with the seasons"
	- the govt is an important natural part of the human condition
		- the govt should not actively persue things
		- shouldnt persue more territory, shouldnt persue more comfort
	- avoid knowledge, avoid desire, when you start to build these things up, you move away from the Dao, and things can collapse back in on themselves
		- "the Dao always turns back"
	- "keep people in a childlike state" not too sophisticated
- Submissiveness
	- the submissive overcome the hard and the strong
	- hold fast to the submissive
	- ex. a willow tree will bend, not break, in a strong storm
	- ex. water, flows
- "Turning Back"
	- "snap back to the mean"
	- could be argued that the Dao is cyclical - "the weak become strong, the strong become weak"
	- growing and then falling back to the Dao
	- doesnt necessarily have to happen if you always remain weak, wont fall back the same way someone strong will

opening line
#quote
The Way that can be followed is not the eternal Way.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.

translation - Bruce Linnell
The Dao that can be spoken of is not the ever-constant Dao.
The name that can be named is not the ever-constant name.

James Legge
The Dao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Dao.
The name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging name.

DC Lau
The way that can be spoken is not the constant way.
The name that can be named is not the constant name.

the website we read the DC Lau translation from has dozens of translations
https://terebess.hu/english/tao/lau.html

in verse 2
we see things are defined in terms of their opposites.
as agents of Daoism we want to reside in an easy middle

question someone asked
"how is the Dao De Jing transcribed to governance"
usually Daoism is a personal philosophy of rulers (like how all the presidents have been christian i guess)

"how is intelligence evil?"
persuing intelligence is seen as actively persuing

in verse 4
mention of God in this translation
"always good to be skeptical of translation when we see these allusions to western religion"

verse 8
#quote "Highest good is like water. Because water excels in benefiting the myriad creatures without contending with them and settles where none would like to be, it comes close to the way. ... It is because it does not contend that it is never at fault."

water doesnt try to be anything it is not
also, lot of focus on water management in these earlier texts because of flooding and stufff was a big issue


questions people asked

"how does Daoism contend with the supernatural?"
not really mentioned

"is Daoism trying to teach a way minimalist way of living?"
Lao Tzu is kind of trying to explain why the world and society sux rn

"very similar to buddhist concepts"
buddhism is introduced to china like 600 years after this, but many chinese buddhist concepts are amalgamated from Daoism and other stuff
we'll talk more about buddhism later

"what kind of political strife at this time"
prelude to the warring states period
Zhou dynasty is starting to crumble
[[Timeline of Chinese Dynasties.png]]
771-256 BC Eastern Zhou dynasty, things are falling apart, Confucius' time, warring states period
Confucius would give advice to rulers that was his whole thing
this is the flourishing philosophy period confucianism daoism etc

"structure of china at this time?"
independent states
slavery is common
states unified during the Qin dynasty (221-206 BC), after the Zhou dynasty

"how was government in Shang, Xia dynasties?"
this is legendary history, not really any historical records
not much confirmation besides the fables
meritocratic system, the people who built the water dams and prevent flooding gain power for example

"similarity of daoism and transcendentalism?"
transcendentalism is much later
"i dont know much about transcendentalism"


back to the lecture

in verse 11
#quote 
"Adapt the nothing therein to the purpose in hand, and you will have the use of the cart.
Knead clay in order to make a vessel.
Adapt the nothing therein to the purpose in hand, and you will have the use of the vessel.
Cut out doors and windows in order to make a room.
Adapt the nothing therein to the purpose in hand, and you will have the use of the room.
Thus what we gain is Something, yet it is by virtue of Nothing that this can be put to use."

Idea that nothingness is a core part of the universe
"very similar to Buddhist ideas"
"greek idea about cutting clay to make a sculpture and reveal the sculpture from nothing"


"this is the world and this is the closest i can get to explaining to you what it's like"
- the Dao is unknowable

verse 13
"What is meant by saying that high rank is, like one's body, a source of great trouble?
The reason I have great trouble is that I have a body.
When I no longer have a body, what trouble have I?"

verse 19
"Exterminate learning and there will no longer be worries.

Exterminate the sage, discard the wise,
And the people will benefit a hundredfold;
Exterminate benevolence, discard rectitude,
And the people will again be filial;
Exterminate ingenuity, discard profit,
And there will be no more thieves and bandits.

These three, being false adornments, are not enough
And the people must have something to which they can attach themselves:
Exhibit the unadorned and embrace the uncarved block,
Have little thought of self and as few desires as possible."

one of the essential descriptions in daoism of how to act
if you remove value, you remove thieves
removing chaos
we shouldnt try to become sages
inactiveness

"these passages are passed down by the elite" - how have they changed due to that?

"how popular was Daoism at this time period?"
it has the most influence looking back
it was many philophical strains circulating at the time
Confucianism Buddhism Daoism seen as the three historical big ones (Buddhism is later)
