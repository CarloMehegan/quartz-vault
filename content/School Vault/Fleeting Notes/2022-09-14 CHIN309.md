description:: discussing Confucius and [[The Analects]]

last reading, the Dao De Jing, gave the idea that chinese philosophy is confusing
the analects, read in comic book format
designed to convey a conversational nature of the ideas in the book


##### Historical background
so far back, its legend
learned from archeological info

meritocracy was one of the fundamental guiding principles

3 sovereigns 5 emperors essentially demigods

xia dynasty
- throne is inherited
- emperors get worse and worse
- empire falls apart and someone else has to take over
shang dynasty
- founder of shang dynasty overtook the throne from last evil emperor
- descendants of shang thought they had divine right to rule
- (see this again and again) shang dynasty founded by benevolent rulers, throne gets passed down, things get worse and worse, eventually next dynasty takes over
zhou dynasty
- tries to set itself up as inheritors of early shang dynasty's king's right to rule
	- had to come up with some way of justifying why they deserved to rule
	- mandate of heaven
		- not necessarily direct lineage from a "(god)" that allows you to rule, but the ability to rule
	- when one becomes unworthy to rule, someone else inherits the mandate
	- some historians argue that the zhou dynasty made up the xia dynasty in order to justify overthrowing the shang
	- the xia had it and lost it to the shang, the shang had it and now lose it to the zhou
- shift in ideas in what is needed in order to rule
	- not just controlling things, but ruling ethically
- zhou dynasty begins to hit rocky times just like dynasties before, and they feel the danger that they will lose it
- nobles start to fight amongst themselves
-  -> here is where confucius enters the picture
- social norms are breaking down, states are warring

##### Confucius
born near the end of zhou dynasty
unlike lao tzu, it is undisputed confucius was a real person
born in a state that had its roots in shang dynasty, still has culture etc of early zhou dynasty
not able to leverage family's influence, not born from wealth
may have worked in lower positions in the govt
spent his life teaching people how to go around and teach others how to govern
- his disciples have a lot of influence later
- confucius' students went on to work for many people confucius hated
anglization of his name - comes from master con, or something idk but it wasnt confucius
credited with creating the five classes
- collections of various earlier texts
- weve seen the book of documents
- others
- the analects
	- major repository of his teachings
	- some think it was compiled by his students

##### [[The Analects]]
many versions, many contradicting passages
represents one piece of a larger system of thought
a lot of what we think of as Confucian philosophy has changed since this was first circulated
there were many schools of thought around Confucius' time
doesn't see a lot of success until 200-300 years after his death (see Han dynasty)

the model of governance
- the government/state should mimic a family

relation with deities
- generally avoids mention of supernatural
- except to the extent that people should follow the old rituals

community depends on people caring for each other
nurture first, teach second, govern last
confucius believes the shang dynasty doesnt start to fail until it stops caring about people

ritual
- becomes a way for rulers to fulfill their obligations to society
- ex. performing rituals to ensure a good harvest
- confucius is not interested in gods, etc, interested in how to run a state

power dynamics
- the government's responsibilities to the people

the gentleman
- the primary goal of any personm particularly a learned person, is to become a gentleman
- this concept of a gentleman *prior to this was someone of aristocratic birth*
- confucius redefines this to be someone of craft and learnedness
	- cultivation!

Dao vs. Confucius
- the dao is something that just is
- for confucius, people need to act in order for things to go well

humanity
- reverent
- selfless
- concern for others
- benevolence

filial piety
- respect for elders/parents
- "Xiao, or filial piety, is an attitude of respect for parents and ancestors in societies influenced by Confucian thought. Filial piety is demonstrated, in part, through service to one's parents."

other key terms
- duty
- heaven - natural processes


##### looking at the readings
1:1 reflecting on what it means to be noble
sometimes its confucius saying something, sometimes its his students
1:2 filial piety
- if youre thoughtful towards your parents -> will be thoughtful towards superiors in society -> will not cause trouble in society
- all comes back to how you treat your family/elders
1:3 mirrors 1:1
throughout these verses, gaining a set of prescriptions on how to act with others/in society/towards ourselves/in leadership
1:5 even if youre doing the right things, critical you do them at the right time
1:6 be honest, care for others around you, finally, study if you have time

question "did he think about how if youre a peasant you will most likely be unable to study"
probably not, mostly thinking about people who would be advising to kings
generally confucius avoids talking about starting point in society

question "fascism and confucianism"
early critique that this is just saying to do what your parents say and be obedient and stuff
scholars refuted that it's a part of it but also the govt has obligations to the people

1:8 "the gentleman"
emphasis on self correction

2:3 the educated person will be shamed into behaving properly because they know it is bad if they are educated
if youre only afraid of doing crimes out of being punished then thats not good enough
you should be able to set the standard as a benevolent ruler
"the perception that others would be disappointed is critical here"

2:4 famous one
its never too late to start
"when i was fifteen i set my mind on learning"
"by thirty i was well established"
"by forty" etc

2:7 dont just provide for parents materially, emotional responsibility, feel deep respect for your parents

2:13 "a gentleman puts his words into actions before putting his actions into words"

think of how this is different from daoism
would a daoists rules for governance look like this? no not at all really
thats why daoism becomes more of a personal philosophy and not a governing one

2:14 idea of the small person as the opposite of the gentleman

2:15 general guidance on how to go about study
study without reflection is folly
reflection without study is risky

2:16 to become an expert in outlandish ideas is simply harmful
possibly critique of daoism / other teachings

3:7 a gentlemen does not contend, but when he must, he does it through archery
another translation
	the master said, the noble minded never contend
	it is true that archery is a kind of contention, but they bow/then compete/descend and bow again/exchange toasts
the lesson is in good sportsmanship / competing is ok with ritual attached to it / respect

question "where would confucius draw the line in contention/challenging other schools of thought like daoism"
is contention in study different from this kind of competition?

saying we need to have rituals in order to have these contentions and perform amicably

3:15 asking questions, being humble rather than presuming to know everything - this is proper ceremony

3:17 the sacrificial goat
"zigong, what you care about is the goat, what i care about is the ceremony"
saying zigong is being stingy, the details arent as critical as the ceremony itself

confucius' relationship with his students is interesting, some presented as brilliant, some not as smart

3:19 confucius talking to a sovereign
government obligations to the people
ruler acts in accordance of ritual with ministers, gives them the freedom to do what they need to do

5:9 (skipping ahead) yan hui
"neither of us are as good as he is"
confucius talks about yan hui throughout his works with regret, because he died young (pour one out for my guy)
confucius' relationship with yan hui is fascinating

4:3 4:4 shows yan hui as a good student (RIP)

4:12 "if you only follow self interest people will resent you" a lot of verses are just advice on how to act

4:17 "when you see someone (better than you) emulate them, when you see someone (bad) reflect and make sure you do not share their qualities"

5:15 the meaning of "cultured"
advice for rulers - dont be so high and mighty that you cant listen to thsoe below you

12:2 the golden rule
"do not treat others how you dont like to be treated"


was he intending for us to learn from his mistakes?
did he have a conflated ego?
is he setting himself up to be the paragon of virtue? i mean probably not?
is it because his students are transcribing these analects and they see him in this way?
