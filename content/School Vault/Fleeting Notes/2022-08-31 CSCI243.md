syllabus overview
Putting the Science in Computer Science
opposite of discrete is continuous
spend a lot of time with proof techniques, induction, contradiction
no programming in this class just pseudocode
two tests one homework every week
homework is not where i test (go to office hours for help)
tests should use similar logic to assignments
people say "this is the hardest class ive taken" why is that - uses math
dont get behind
review basic algebra - thats whats used in class
empty hand honor code policy
can use books internet but must reference all sources used in assignment
"this class is not about the solution its about the understanding"
homework should be typeset in latex
exams are open note but no internet can use books homeworks pdfs of books printed notes
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) for latex composing and [Latex summary](http://www.cs.wm.edu/~andreas/Teach/243/LaTexInfo/about-latex.html) created by w&m
can use course schedule headings in syllabus for topic note titles

first lecture

Tools of mathematical reasoning
	*Logic* - the art of reasoning - λoγos
	*Discrete structures* - countable numbers

Logic and proofs
	*Truth* - what does truth mean in terms of logic/cs?
		sensory? non debatable? quantitative? can be proven? agreed upon?
		in empirical science - corresponding to facts
		sociological - formed by society
		platonic - existing outside humans
	*Coherence*
		set of principles considered true (axioms)
		-> use a set of deduction tools (basic reasoning)
		-> to form theorems
	truths dont have to correspond to facts (axioms are assumed and used to form theorems)
		ex. Euclidean geometry assumes things about points and lines - axioms
		Non-Euclidean geometry does not start with the same axioms
