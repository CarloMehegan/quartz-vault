man how am i gonna take notes for this class
syllabus overview
two midterms in class
attendance is tracked
homework is graded (thank god) not accepted late solutions posted after due date

"The fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt"
-Bertrand Russell

"How to study"
- take quick notes during class
- reveiw detailed notes on blackboard
- detailed notes have blanks to fill in
- NICE

first lecture
1. Applications
	Stocks
	Linear algebra will help manage your portfolio
	ex. picking three stocks want to invest $1000 how do you split it?
	Linear algebra is a science about metrics
	see sketch 1

2. A linear system
	A linear system is comprised of multiple linear equations
	A linear equation looks like

A linear system - A collection of linear equations with the same variables

A solution of a linear system $(x_1, x_n) = (s_1, ... , s_n)$ makes linear system correct

A solution set - multiple solutions

Two linear systems are equivalent if and only if (<=>) they have the same solution set.

The solution set of any linear system contains
a. A unique set (intersecting lines like the example)
b. no solutions (two parallel lines)
c. infinite number of solutions (overlapping parallel lines)
If you forget the formulas for solving linear systems, think back to this graphical solution

A linear sytem is consistent if - case (a) or (c) - has at least one solution
A linear system is inconsistent if - case (b) - has no solution

The dimension of a matrix is - # Rows x # Columns

What's the easiest matrix to do substitution with? (what is happening?)
A Triangular Matrix!

Ok class is over that was very hectic and maybe difficult to read jumping between ipad and laptop in that room sucks because the desk is so small and it takes a bit to transition and i had to do it 5 times in like 25 minutes so i should either take all the notes in goodnotes and then translate that to obsidian topic notes or maybe write all in excalidraw and like get an ipad keyboard or honestly i really didnt write all that much text well hmm maybe i keep a goodnotes journal for this class and then i add like figure numbers to reference in obsidian because im still writing definitions but if im gonna do that i might as well just keep doing this
ok in class ipad only just goodnotes then i upload those notes to obsidian as pdf as fleeting notes and then i translate those to topic notes? also i have like homework now for this class right i should do that also theres the detailed notes shes giving lets see if those are substantial and maybe i can use those
another important thing is that i hate writing in excalidraw it is not fun and does not feel write goodnotes is way better
