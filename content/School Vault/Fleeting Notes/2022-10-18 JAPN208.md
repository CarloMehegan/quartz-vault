description::discussing [[Japanese Immigrant Settler Colonialism in the US-Mexican Borderlands and the US Racial-Imperialist Politics of the Hemispheric 'Yellow Peril'|Japanese Immigrant...'Yellow Peril']]

two lectures coming to campus relating to this class
japanese culture association putting on a culture event at the crim dell meadow
free food

##### speakers
race is a big factor
issei - japanese migrants before 19-- educated population
brought imperialism back to japan
missed stuff..
pattern repeats
japanese go to south america
monroe doctrine
forced movement
pearl harbor
internment camps

azuma was talking ab relationship between japanese issei settlers and american people
positive outlook on going to america, new frontier
writing back to japan saying it was going well
white population started to harbor resentment
petty
moving to mexico
pay was better in us, more racial freedom in mexico
anecdote two guys offered a lot of land to build colonies for issei
"where they would do their own thing"
anti japanese sentiment, didnt do it
petty
yellow peril mindset
anti asian hemisphere
all before wwii
when pearl harbor happened, "their first real reason", ramped up on policy

racial exclusion and mistreatment of japanese people
19th century
fueled by japanese victory in sino japanese war
japan claimed european territory
propaganda involving japans appetite for victory emerged
first issei felt proud to grow and develop in a country alongside white people, felt superior, put down others
whites started to ignore good things and only harbored resentment against japanese
cross border mobility
interpreted as a malicious act
fearmongering
pattern of fearmongering and propaganda
america viewed japanese as a racial enemy

issei = "first generation"

##### Eiichiro Azuma's [[Japanese Immigrant Settler Colonialism in the US-Mexican Borderlands and the US Racial-Imperialist Politics of the Hemispheric 'Yellow Peril']]
- By "settler colonialism," what does the author mean?
	- Japanese immigrants were making america their new home
	- by japan sending people to america nad buying land, those immigrants are the settlers, can carve out space for japan in america
	- other examples of settler colonialism
		- manifest destiny
		- military bases in foreign countries
		- irish mass immigration to new england, also treated poorly
	- if Azuma is using the term colonialism to describe the activities of the japanese people, then how do you think he evaluates these activities?
		- he thinks it was negative?
		- japan saw america as land that was easy to conquer, author thinks thats wrong, but its also wrong how america responded
		- motivations behind coming to the us, buying land, settling down
		- these immigrants were aware of what they were doing
		- knew of the goal to bring japanese people to america
		- Azuma paints it in a negative light
- What is the author's main argument?
	- japanese settler colonialism and the change in american racial politics, yellow peril
	- close link
	- settlers had a clear vision of expanding the influence of japan into america
	- did japanese americans have a justifiable fear of japans influence? even if so, yellow peril was still wrong
	- i didnt type a lot of the stuff said here
- "Race" is an important category of analysis in the author's argument. How does he employ it?
	- i dont understand the question tbh
		- he seems to draw the lines between races
		- "race war"
		- talks about japanese vs white americans, etc
		- not necessarily the japanese govt vs the american govt
	- people looked at each other through the lens of race
		- japanese people viewed themselves as separate, better than chinese
		- racial hierarchy
		- americans saw japanese as lesser
	- monroe doctrine was a big part of his argument
		- how the doctrine turned from being anti european to anti japanese, became racist
		- legalized/legitimized racist actions
	- We've talked about race and racism as categories of analysis, what other categories can we think of?
		- socioeconomic status / class, lot of the issei were farmers
		- gender
		- if we incorporate class into this analysis, what kind of story could we tell?
		- what about gender? how can we analyze this through these different categories?
			- gentlemans agreement, lots of single japanese men in the us
			- definitely more issei men than women
		- race isnt the only way to analyze this, we are using azumas argument to look into and study the events further
- What is the link between Japanese immigration and "yellow peril"?
- What new understandings of Japanese immigration to the United States and Mexico does his argument bring?
> [!Quote]
> Far from the conventional image of Asian ‘‘sojourners,’’ many educated Issei considered themselves to be modern settler colonists intent on conquering a wilderness, just like their Anglo-Saxon predecessors, for the sake of advancing civilization.
- Azuma is bringing a new understanding to these events by highlighting Japan's intent


Describe in one word
- subtle power struggle
- racial exclusion
- fearmongering


Next time, looking more at Japanese in America, this time focusing on Nissei, second generation
