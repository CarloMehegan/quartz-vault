ive got all these checkboxes and they make sense for discrete and lin alg but what about the rest? i dont know how i want to organize those notes
i should have like a master page maybe for each class
i mean i have the hubs already right but like a master document for notes or something like that i just need to make some kind of notes for sw and chin and japn for my system to make sense
but realistically im not gonna do that if its gonna take a long time
