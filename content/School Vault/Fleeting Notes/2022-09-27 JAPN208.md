description:: discussing [[Travels in Manchuria and Mongolia]]

reading for today was yosano akiko [[Travels in Manchuria and Mongolia]]
i did not read much of it

peoples initila thoughts
- transitioned from how nice and beautiful scenery was, by the end was all about war and japanese occupation
- here, chinese resent japanese occupation, whereas before, japan resented european occupation
- can tell author was a poet and translator, focuses on parallels between japanese and chinese language, culture
- saw a lot of different places, started in big cities, saw more rural areas as moved north

couple more important historical context pieces we didnt talk about last time

Manchuria and China circa 1928
- military tension rising, japan didnt fully control manchuria yet
- transitional period

before this point
- Kwantung Leased Territory 1905 - gained small peninsula, in south manchuria, japan rule spread north from there
- 1911 revolution - Qing dynasty overthrown, Republic of China established
	- connection to [[ðŸ§§CHIN309 Hub|CHIN309]], but this is way later
- during WWI, Japan occupies german ports and operations in Shandong province (another peninsula part of china in yellow sea)
- 21 demands from japan, 1915 - japan trying to consolidate their interests in china
- Yuan Chikai, president of republic of china, dies 1916 - warlords compete for power
- Russian Revolution 1917 - japan fears soviet support for republic of china
- japan dispatches troops to shandong, 1927-28

##### questions to consider from last time
- What did Yosano see in Manchuria? What did she not see?
	- found it interesting she got to see prisons, effects of opium, opium dens, interesting she saw these even though she was a more high status traveler
	- still didnt see much of the chinese peoples' regular lives
	- paid a lot of attention to temples
	- including tourist-oriented temples, where she refused to stay the night
		- left because temple didnt have a rich history to learn about like the other temples did
	- paid attention to the economic activities, exports, soybean farms, mines, economic issues, businesses
	- comparing japanese buildings to chinese buildings
	- enjoyed reflecting on the historical sights she saw
	- she romanticized the trip, focused on the beautiful aspects
		- landscape, temples, a good portion of it focused on these beautiful parts, not the bad parts
		- wanted to go to places with nice scenery, rich history
	- "cigarettes and liquor dont make for good poems, but mountains and clear skies do"
	- she was a well known poet at the time she was writing this; unlike bird, was writing with audience in mind, where bird was writing to her sister
		- how would bird's writing change if she was writing with an audience in mind? maybe she was and just framed it smartly in a more candid way?
	- recommended a lot of the places she visited by other poets, and in her writing, was recommending places herself
	- avoided the zones where tensions are getting heated, for their own safety, places where anti-japanese sentiments were strong
	- travel funded by south manchurian railway, they told her and her travel group where to go
- How does she interact with people in Manchuria?
	- not much but there is some
	- im so sleepy im gonna fall asleep im so tired and sleepy
	- talks about chinese laborers
		- cheap labor, not paid well
		- do we see the same degree of judgement in her writing as Bird?
			- she seems to have less interest in the chinese people than bird did in japanese people
			- barely refers to chinese people by their names, much like bird
	- interacts with a lot of japanese people
	- is she racist?
		- easy to say bird was racist, she was so explicit
		- akiko is writing in the 1920s, historical context different, doesnt use vulgar language to describe people
		- does she feel superior to chinese people?
		- she looks down on living conditions
- What sensibilities does Yosano have and how do they differ from Bird's or Fukuzawa's?
- Does she talk about Japan's colonialism? Is she a colonizer?
	- she's silently corroborating
	- she recognizes the issue, but sees it more as a hassle to get around
	- elephant in the room
	- she doesnt write about it much
	- she seems to view herself as superior
	- she is benefiting from the system
		- her presence itself, brought there on a trip paid for by a company, avoiding areas of high tension
		- able to go to hotels, hot springs, where the colonialism is not as much of a visible problem
		- the railway is staffed entirely by japanese
		- she was safer traveling through manchuria than others
		- is benefiting from this book
		- benefiting from seeing culture, gained inspiration for her work, wrote poems about nature and history she saw
			- benefited intellectually
		- at the fundamental level her desire to travel to manchuria itself was possibly shaped by colonialism
			- couldnt have imagined going to manchuria if not for japanese presence there
	- was she aware of what japan was doing in manchuria?
		- probably yes
		- seems to be fully aware based on parts of her writing
		- wants to ignore it
		- wont let it ruin her trip!
		- how does she reconcile this tension?
		- with her trip since it was funded and safe, her experience was very different than someone else traveling through manchuria without the same resources
		- easier for her to only talk about the good things and brush over the other stuff
- How can we apply the concept of "contact zone"?
	- examples of contact zones
		- she notes in a town that there are many buddhist and daoist temples next to each other
		- the japanese businesses in manchuria
		- construction of tourist economy in manchuria
		- making japanese food/products to attract business
	- example of anti conquest
		- she was separating herself from the colonizing
		- she avoids the colonialism issue for the most part, but still feels superior
		- the railway company, has a huge amount of control, but says theyre just doing it for tourism

many people that travelled this way (with varying levels of resources/privilege)
next class moving on to next module, **Migration**

describing in one word
- ironic; we just saw similar travel into japan, now japan is doing it to other countries
