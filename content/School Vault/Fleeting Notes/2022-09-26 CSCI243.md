description:: sets, cardinality, power set, cartesian product

doing class on zoom sitting outside my dorm
continuing sets
$\emptyset$ means empty set

Sets A and B are equal
	$A = B \leftrightarrow A \subseteq B \wedge B \subseteq A$
$\subseteq$ means "a subset of"

Proper subset $\subset$
	think of $\subseteq$ like "$\subset$ or equal to"

Venn diagram

This shows Set A, $A \subset B$, and two ways for $A \neq B$

How many elements does a set have?
	may be finite or infinite
	$|S|$ is called the **cardinality** of a finite set $S$, defined as the number of elements in $S$.

For a given set $S$ the **power set** of $S$, $P(S)$ or $2^S$, is the **set of all subsets** of $S$.
	ex. If $S = \{0,1,2\}$,
	then $P(S) = \{\emptyset, \{0\}, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{0,1\}, \{0,2\}, \{1,2\}\}$
	$|P(S)| = 8 = 2^{|S|} = |2^S|$
	e.g. with every new element, we double the sets that can be produced
	even if it was $S = \{ \emptyset , 1, 2 \}$ , or $S = \{\emptyset, \alpha, \beta\}$, then $|P(S)|$ still $= 8$

Cartesian Product
For two sets A and B, the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted by $A \times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs from A and B, ie $A \times B = {(a,b)|a \in A \wedge b \in B}$
	ex. A = {z,x}, B = {$25, $50, $100}
	A×B = {(z,$25),(z,$50),(z,$100),(x,$25),(x,$50),(x,$100}
	note that $B \times A \neq A \times B$, will have same number of elements, but different combination
$|A \times B = |A||B|$
	same number of elements 

Cartesian Product of many sets
	A1 ×A2 ×··· ×An = {(a1,...,an)|ai ∈ Ai ,i = 1,...n}
	(copied from lecture notes rewrite later)
	The ordered {a_1, ... a_n} is called $n$-tuple
	ex. $\{a\} \times \{ 1, 2\} \times \{Z, Q\}$
	$= \{(a,1),(a,2)\} \times \{Z, Q\}$
	$= \{(a,1,Z),(a,2,Z),(a,1,Q),(a,2,Q)\}$
	if we for example used $\{a, b\}$, number of (tuples? tuples or sets or elements whats the parentheses ones called) would double
