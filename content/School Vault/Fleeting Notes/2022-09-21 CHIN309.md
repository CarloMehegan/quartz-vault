description:: discussing [[Li Sao]]

(i did not read this reading before class)
## [[Li Sao]] (tr. On Countering Sorrow)
written by Qu Yuan
title is interesting, shows some complexities of language
li - to encounter or to depart from

contained within the Chu Ci (tr. Songs of the South)
- one of the most famous collections of poetry
- more coherent in overall style than the classic of poetry (we talked about before)
- origins are difficult to figure out
- supposedly all the works within are by the same person
	- today we believe that half or so were written by one guy, the rest written in a similar style later
	- Qu Yuan
- when we think of the classics of poetry, more northern, these poems were the opposite

##### Qu Yuan
- highly respected by a king
- had a rival that tried to undermine his work
- king fell for it and qu yuan was sad
- the Li Sao may be about how qu yuan was mad at the king
- rival becomes king
- "Qu Yuan came to the banks of the river hair disheveled singing as he went clasping a stone to his bosom he threw himself into the river and perished"
- revered in the Han dynasty because of his literary skill
- ill fated life heavily romanticized, particularly that he remained loyal to his king
- poets would drop poems into the river to honor him

##### Style of the Li Sao
- "out of left field compared to earlier works"
- Xi character
	- doesnt seem to have a meaning
	- accentuates each line of these poems
	- seems to be where the music would take over when the poem is performed
	- eventually the Xi is dropped
	- 6 characters + xi, 6 characters
	- 7, 6
- Point of View
	- seems to be from multiple points of view
- Interpretation
	- allegorical, represents the relationship between Qu Yuan and his king
	- modern scholars tend to read against this interpretation, it was common to interpret poems in a political light
	- why are poems interpreted in a political light so often?
- Reflection of Chu culture
	- belief in magic
	- shamans were a fundamental part of Chu culture
		- called upon nature for help and guidance
	- to the author, descriptions of magic arent metaphorical, thought to be fundamentally possible

##### Reading the Li Sao
David Hawkes
- famous translator of Chinese literature

line 1 "Scion of the High Lord Kao Yang..."
"took omens" - strong culture of divination
author is establishing connection to the gods, divine birth
"basically saying im important by virtue of my birth"
author? narrator? point of view character whoever this is

relationship between inner and outer beauty
fear of aging
fear of time passing by
focus on flora "autumn orchids, selinea, shady angelica"
speaker is presenting themself as important person of society, becomes clearer as we go that they are presenting themself as a shaman

seen often in this literature
spring = time of birth
autumn = time of growing older

"feared that my Fairest's beauty would fade too"
who is this? the narrator, the king, love interest?

idea of things being in their proper place
"otherwise society cant function"

"three kings of old"
mention of the legendary three kings

"pepper and cinnamon"
fragrant plants
fragrant plants lose their fragrance over time
political interpretation about dynasties rising and falling
the first kings of the dynasties are righteous and good, the last kings are bad and crooked and have lost the mandate of heaven

in shamanistic practice, as they run out of fragrance, they lose power to do shaman stuff
could represent Qu Yuan's ability to serve his king as a minister, losing the power to do so

"the Fragrant One"
"who these people are is subject to literally thousands of years of arguments"
according to David Hawkes:
	the chinese word used here is the name of a flower
	interpreted to mean the poets king
	may be a term of the endearment

"loyalty brings disaster" even though it is important to be loyal

line 29
"thought famine should pinch me it is small matter
but i grieve that all my blossoms should waste in rank weeds"

line 33
"for old age comes creeping and soon will be upon me
and i fear i shall not leave behind an enduring name"

fears not being remembered - contrasts from themes weve seen in other readings
in [[2022-09-19 CHIN309#Zhuangzi Basic Writings|Zhuangzi]] and in [[2022-09-14 CHIN309#The Analects|Confucianism]], big criticisms of chasing fame

line 34
"in the morning i drank the dew that fell from the magnolia
at evening ate the petals that dropped from chrysanthemums"
not very filling food

line 35-37
speaker is adorning themselves with all of these plants
we havent seen talk of fashion in other works

line 38-39
"I take my fashion from the food men of old
a garb unlike that which the rude world cares for
though it may not accord with present day manners
i will follow the pattern that P'eng Hsien has left"

"reminds me of this simpsons clip"
	grandpa simpson "i had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the name"
Qu Yuan talking about the styles at the time

line 45
seems like it switches between a woman talking and a man talking
but it should be just one person speaking
trans icon perhaps?
"all your ladies were jealous of my delicate beauty"
	interpreted as a metaphor for the king's other ministers
Qu Yuan was using both men and women's voices to represent himself
ok genderfluid icon

"you can see why these political interpretation is very tempting"
what other interpretations are there?

question from someone - "relationship to hundred flowers campaign"

line 48-50
god complex?
speaker sees themself as better than those around them

at a certain point the speaker says "im out of here" to chase off after a god/goddess

line 58. another line about fashion

line 65?
"I could not change this even if my body were dismembered"
sheesh

line 68
"why be so lofty with you passion for prity?
why must you alone have such delicate adornment?"
talking about fashion again
"thorns, king-grass, curly-ear hold the place of power
but you must needs stand apart and not speak them fair"

question from someone - "is this walking the line of being seditious?"
yes (i dont really get why these lines specifically are) but the king was dead already when this was written
scholars later said "look at how Qu Yuan feels free to speak in criticism of his king we should all do this even if it risks death"

"you cannot go from door to door convincing everybody
no one can say 'see, look into my mind!'"
confucius was doing this, traveling to states teaching

line 97-
starts getting mythical and weird
the very gods themselves being his companions
"still not able to influence the world in the way he wants to"

line 113- 
tries to woo a goddess is unsuccessful

skipping ahead

lots of flower talk frrr 

things dont go well for him

line 186 - 187: the end
"enough! there are no true men in the state: no one to understand me.
why should i cleave to the city of my birth?
since none is worthy to work with in making good government,
i will go and join P'eng Hsien in the place where he abides."

peng hsien and qu yuan both drowned themselves

##### remarks on the reading
other ppls remarks:
beauty is mentioned a lot, very different from previous readings
hypocritical; talks about being humble, has a god complex
feels very "I was born in the wrong generation" 
didnt expect for later figures to revere this character - how did it get to that point?
	very well received starting like 130 years after being written
themes of rejection and loneliness, coping "well the gods like me"
	"narrator is definitely depressed"
does Qu Yuan self insert himself as the narrator?
	people have read this typically as autobiographical
	very plausible assumption; what we know about the historical figure lines up well with what we see in the poem

my remarks:
very queer interpretation possible
was there gay representation back then i mean probably not but how was that received


next time
Sima Qian's revords of the grand historian - Annals of Emperor Gaozu
"can be difficult to follow - uses multiple names/titles for one person"
