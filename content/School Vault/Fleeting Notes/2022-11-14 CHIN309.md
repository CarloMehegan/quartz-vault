description:: discussing [[Journey to the West]]

last time discussed dream of the red chamber and [[A Burial Mound for Flowers]] from it

this week diving deeper into one novel, [[Journey to the West]]
looking at one chapter today and another on wednesday

quite a bit different from the other novels weve seen
more fantastical, focuses more on religious ideas
takes place during tang dynasty
written during the ming dynasty, 16th century

##### Buddhism in the Tang Dynasty
how buddhism existed only marginally related to how its used in the novel
existed in china since approx 2nd c
zen buddhism - buddhism merging with taoism
novel based on a historical figure

##### Xuan Zang, 602-664
- story centered around this monk, sometimes called Xuanzang or Tripitaka (he doesnt show up in what we read today tho)
- moved around a lot during tang dynasty being founded, last dynasty falling
- began learning sanskrit and hoped to find original buddhist writings, the sutras in order to make sure they were properly translated
- took him 16 years
- memorials today along various stops in his route
- acquired over 600 buddhist texts written in india and brought them to china
- tang emperor had converted to buddhism at this time
- this preserved some buddhist texts that would have otherwise been lost
- credited with translating over 1000 different volumes of sanskrit texts into chinese

##### Great Tang Records of the Western Regions
- emperor asked Xuan Zong to record his travels
- novel is based on these writings

##### Wu Cheng'en c. 1500-1582
- wrote [[Journey to the West]]
- never able to pass the imperial exams
- was poor, had no family
- widely renowned as a poet
- wrote journey to the west anonymously, novels still not really academically respected at this time, just lowbrow entertainment
	- "like reality tv"
- many translations
	- most famous translation, an abridged version called Monkey
	- version we read done by Anthony Yu(?), known for being very very accurate and heavily footnoted
	- novel is very funny but Yu's translation doesnt capture the rhythm/humor of the novel
- novel can be split into parts
	- we meet the monkey king
	- we meet tripitaka
	- bulk of novel about getting to india and acquiring the sutras
	- very brief ending going back to china
- not like the three kingdoms, "relatively sober account of historical events", instead a more fantastical take
- A few main characters
	- Tang Sanzang (The Monk)
	- Sun Wukong (the monkey king)
	- Zhu Bajie (piggy)
	- Sha Wujing (sandy)
	- theres a horse too
- all the secondary characters experience a fall and offended heaven in some way and are made to aid the monk on his journey as part of their penance
	- sun wukong breaks into the garden of some important goddess and eats a bunch of peaches of immortality and rebels against heaven and they send an army and he defeats an army and then blah abla keeps going until he eventually gets in a fight with The buddha and loses
	- monkey is an agent of chaos, has to learn across the novel to suppress his desire to do whatever comes across his mind

##### Adaptations
- journey to the west is a huge part of chinese culture
- weve seen modern adaptations of the other stories we've talked ab, but theres a lot for the journey to the west
- tv shows, movies, video games, and more
- dragon ball z, son goku shares a lot of characteristics with sun wukong
- Monkey Magic, tv series 1978-80
	- this show looks insane
	- martial arts aspects, flying on clouds
- 1986 CCTV tv show
	- gods in heaven observing the monkey king and discussing him
	- this is also insane
	- this is insane
- another tv series produced in 1996 in hong kong
	- slapstick version
	- aw man copyright claimed no clip
- 1992 cartoon version aired in canada and the us in 2009-10
	- Journey to the West - Legends of the Monkey King
	- this is a lot less scary than the live action versions
	- removed from its buddhist context
- silent movie from 1927
- very first full length animated chinese movie, Princess Iron Fan 1941
	- black and white very early animation

##### Looking at the reading
- Chapter 2 from the novel, about Sun Wukong, Monkey, talking to his master
- 2 stories being told in this chapter
	- first section, scene where monkey king is being taught by Subodhi
	- second part where he returns to where he came from and is rescuing monkeys from his country from a monster
- poetry in the novel
	- often there to emphasize things, shift speed of the narrative
- the story
- the monkey king left his country with the goal of enlightenment, in order to attain immortality
- they start to civilize him, gaining a basic education that a young monk might get
- many of the monks studying under this master have attained immortality already
- spends seven years hanging out
- one day teacher comes out to lecture about the nature of the universe, daoism, buddhism, explaining things
- monkey is so excited by the lesson he starts jumping around and interrupts the lesson
- the teacher asks him what his goal is and why hes here
- he says he wants to learn whatever has a smidgen of daoist flavor, really he wants to gain immortality
- teacher says there are 360 heteronomous divisions within the tradition of dao
- he offers different paths and monkey refuses to learn them because they dont reach his goals (immortality and monkey stuf)
- the patriarch/teacher storms out but monkey thinks he was trying to give him a riddle about meeting him later that night to give him a secret lesson
- monkey goes and turns out he really did have a secret lesson and he starts practicing his secret breathing technique and stuff and starts gaining magical powers
- three years later the patriarch comes back to train him further about the three calamities that can still kill him
- monkey is like no im immortal but the patriarch says he needs to work to prevent these calamities
- i dont feel like writing even more blah blah yeah
- patriarch says he cant teach him any more, he goes back to his home country, they are endangered by a monster, he saves his brethren using his new powers
- he fights the monstrous king and saves the monkeys
- very different from the first part of the story, martial arts fighting, very fantastical combat
	- its giving cradle lowkey,,
- end
- later hes not content to jsut be king of the monkeys he goes farther etc hes imprisoned by the heavens under a mountain and after 500 years is made to aid the monk in his travels

Thoughts on the reading
- funny how the patriarch tells him to never tell anyone he was his teacher
- interesting how creative and fantastical the story is
- monkey is a very distinct character - chaotic trickster with a lot of weaknesses to pair with his supernatural strengths, makes him a n interesting character
- throughout the story theres part where their biggest hope is an angry monkey and it can get wild
