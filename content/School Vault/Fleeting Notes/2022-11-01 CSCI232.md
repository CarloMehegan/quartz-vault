solved problem A - Cinema Seating
solution:
```python
rows, columns = map(int,input().split())
people = int(input())

# want to save the inputs for the end
input_list = [""]*people

# seating grid
grid = [ [0]*columns for i in range(rows)]

for i in range(people):
    person = input()
    input_list[i] = person
    y, x = map(int,person.split())
    # account for index difference (ex 2nd column 3rd row is (1, 2))
    x -= 1
    y -= 1
    # increment the person's seat and all 8 adjacent seats
    for a in range(3):
        for b in range(3):
            place_y = y-1+a
            place_x = x-1+b
            # check that spot is within bounds of array
            if place_x >= 0 and place_x <= columns-1 and place_y >= 0 and place_y <= rows-1:
                # print("trying " + str(place_x) + ", " + str(place_y))
                grid[place_y][place_x] += 1

# list of frequencies, used for final output
freq_list = [0]*9
# print(str(grid))

# use the inputs saved earlier, check the seating grid at each position
# this value is the number of neighbors the seat has + 1
for i in range(people):
    y, x = map(int,input_list[i].split())
    freq = grid[y-1][x-1]
    # print("trying " + str(freq))
    # subtract 1 bc seat counts itself as a neighbor
    freq_list[freq-1] += 1


# format output and print
output = ""
for i in range(9):
    output = output + str(freq_list[i]) + " "

# ex "0 0 4 0 4 0 0 0 0"
print(output.rstrip())

```
