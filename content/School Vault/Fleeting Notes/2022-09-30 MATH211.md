description::inverse matrix, properties of invertible matrix

skipped class bc hurricane

```
Dear all,

Given the current weather condition and the scary forecast, please feel free NOT to attend today's class.

We will work out an example for the inverse of matrix and finish Section 11 (Book 2.3). Section 11 is all about a theorem that connects previous concepts with the invertible matrix. You can read it. But for this class, my focus is to help you understand definitions but not remember theorems.

Stay safe,

Yuting
