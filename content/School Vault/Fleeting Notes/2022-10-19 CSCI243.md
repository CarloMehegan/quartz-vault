description:: reviewing test 1, big O notation

##### reviewing test
i got a 84!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

q1 predicate algebra or whatever i got this right i think
q2 membership table ez
q3 $\Pi^n_{i=1} 2^i$ got this too $= 2^{\frac {n(n+1)} 2}$
q4 $\sum^n_{i=1} \sum^m_{j=1} p^{j+log_p i}$ think i did ok? cant remember i know got to $\sum^n_{i=1} \sum^m_{j=1} p^j *i$ yeah i dont think i got to the wait no maybe i did get this i dont remmeber

q5 prove by induction fibonacci 3n is even yeah maybe i got half credit for base case and inductive hypothesis but i didnt get the inductive step

ok i couldve done that



back to class
##### Big-O Notation

ex. 3x and $x^2$
$x^2$ grows faster
but if $x = 1, x = 2$, then 3x is slower!

$3x = O(x^2)$
$\exists x, k : 3x < cx^2, \forall x \geq k$
choose c = 1
pick k = 2

ex. $x^2 + 2x +1 = O(2x^2)$
c = $\frac 1 2$?
$x^2 + 2x +1 \leq \frac 1 2 (2x^2) = x^2$
no doesnt work
c = 1?

works or smth
could also use 2
$\forall x \geq 3 \equiv k$
what ok


next ex
$100x^2$ and $x^3$
$100x^2 \leq x^3$
$100 \leq x$ wait we can divide out the $x^2$ idrk whats happening actually
set k = 100 $\forall x \geq k$

2x = O(3x)
2x leq 3x forall x greater than or equal to 1

3x = O(2x)
3x leq 2x * 1.5 = 3x
true for all x geq 1

so constant in front doesnt matter, just matters that both are linear time
i need to watch a video about this or smth

##### Transitivity
If $f = O(g)$ and $g = O(h)$, then $f = O(h)$

##### Highest degree
$f(x) = a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1} +...+ a_1x+a_0$
$f(x) = O(x^n)$ 
"A polynomial grows at the rate of its highest degree. Lower-order terms can be ignored. Constant factors are absorbed in the constant c in the big-O definition."

he's writing out a bunch of stuff i dont get ok hes gonna redo it next class
end of class
