##### [[The Injustice of Dou E]]
dough-uh
- guy named Dou sells his daughter in order to go to the capital and take the imperial exam
- daughter marries the money lender's son, becomes widowed
- two guys extort the money lender one day, want to marry her and her daughter
- guy wants to kill money lender and take Dou E, he poisons soup and accidentally kills his father, frames Dou E and takes her to court she gets executed
- Dou E's father comes back and her ghost talks to him and wants revenge
- supernatural stuff happens after Dou E's execution
	- 3 year drought
	- it snows in midsummer

Modern Interpretations
- Snow in Midsummer
	- done in oregon like 4 years ago
	- english interpretation
- Teochew Opera: _
	- another interpretation
	- in china
	- preserves the muscial parts better than english version
	- instrumentation
	- more traditional interpretation

some considerations
- fascinating window into contemporary culture
	- things we see relate to contemporary norms
	- presented as if assumed/non controversial
	- presented as criticism
- obligations that parents have towards children vs obligations children have towards parents
	- theme we've seen throughout class, explored in this play
- ideas about medicine
	- a quack doctor attacks the money lender
- justice
	- not an accurate depiction, but gives some ideas of what popular perception of justice looked like
	- what is justice
	- how is evidence procured, found
	- what evidence is acceptable
	- different layers of justice - karmic retribution
- the supernatural
	- people loved ghost stories!
	- a trope that the ghosts of wrong people come back to set right the thing that was done to them

what did you think>?
- idk i didnt read but what did others think
- when daughter contacts father as a ghost hes not that frightened he accepts it quickly
- reading this doesnt have the same affect as seeing it played out probably does
- not sure if it was intentionally humorous, but there were funny parts
	- it was probably meant to be funny, meant to be entertaining


##### Looking at the text
- often begin with a prologue
	- opportunity for the actors and actresses to lay out the premise of the play
	- not really a main male protagonist, maybe her father
	- prologue starts with mistress ts'ai, explaining how Scholar Dou sells away his daughter
	- then Scholar Dou comes in and talks about how hes poor and wants to take exam
- they go through the deal making
	- "not atypical for how deal making would have happened"
	- dou is being humble but like his daughter would be marrying down because money lenders dont have a very high social ranking
	- dou would probably have been from the gentry, socially higher, but hes poor like super poor and this is his last resort probably
	- he goes off and takes exams and disappears
- act 1
	- starts with doctor Lu
	- not a good doctor / not a well respected member of society
	- shows Guan Hanqing highlighting socially low ranking people
	- mistress tsai comes back and gives more context
		- "I am Mistress Ts'ai"
		- everyone keeps introducing themselves
	- its been 13 years since Dou E became her daughter
		- she's been widowed for 3 years
	- doctor tries to strangle her, but Chang (Old Chang) and his son (Donkey Chang) rush in to save her
	- changs want reward for saving her - marrying her and the daughter
		- "all sorts of reasons something like this shouldnt be done"
		- when someone is a widow, common idea that they shouldnt be remarried
	- now Dou E introduces herself and gives the premise of the story (for like the fourth time)
	- she laments about her life through song/poem
		- common trope - young woman becomes on the verge of death because of sorrow
		- "note that these plays would be relatively slow" songs were slow
		- singing would have been slower and drawn out, prose would be enunciated loudly and performed slower than conversational speed but not as slow as the songs
	- now we get another recap when mistress tell Dou E what happened
		- Dou E does not want this but mistress tsai says theres not much they can do about it
		- Dou E uses social norms to say why it would be crazy for both of them to be married, for mistress tsai because shes already old and for Dou E shes a widow
		- Dou E is loyal to her husband that passed
	- dou e tells the changs no its not happening and they r mad
- act 2
	- donkey chang plans to poison mistress tsai in order to coerce dou e to marry him which doesnt really make sense but alr
		- he goes to get poison from dr Lu and uses the blackmail that he saw him try to strangle mistress tsai
		- dr lu is scared hes gonna get in trouble and decides to close the shop and sell rat poison in another town
	- Old Chang ends up eating the soup and dies
		- hes dead!
		- donkey chang tries to frame dou e for this and they send for the magistrate
	- prefect enters
		- like the doctor whose patients end up dead, the prefect isnt the best at his job either
			- when a superior comes to inspect he says hes under the weather and stays home
		- donkey chang accuses dou e
	- how evidence is produced
		- "people are mean worms. if you dont beat them, they will not confess"
		- one way evidence is extracted is with torture/beatings
		- we see later this prefect is not doing his job properly
	- dou e doesnt think mistress ts'ai can survive being beaten, so she makes up a confession
		- she wouldnt get married for her mother in law but she will confess to murder to save her from a beating
	- prefect says oki we will execute you tmr
		- when sentencing someone to death theyre supposed to take it to the emperor and stuff and give time and not do it just tmr
		- so this is bad
		- "Injustice escapes not the eyes of Heaven and Earth"
- execution scene
	- one of the more popular scenes to reenact and stuf
	- Dou E's chance to claim her innonence to the universe
		- she asks to hang a white silk, and if blood splashes the silk when shes executed then its a sign of injustice bc if heaven exists then there will be evidence of her injustice or smth
		- it does happens just like she predicted
- act 4 (idk where act 3 started i guess i missed it)
	- Dou E's father comes back to town by coincidence
		- he passed the exam on first try and is now a high ranking official that inspects corrupt officials and unjust courts
		- ironic!
	- he has excuses for not being around whatvr
	- he ends up in town to inspect
		- as he goes to bed one night after reading her criminal case file the ghost of Dou E approaches him
	- Dou E's ghost gets his attention and tries to show him how the case was unjust n get him to investigate
	- we r runnin out of time skipping ahead
	- they find the doctor and chang and all the bad stuff that happens
	- he corrects the injustice and thats the end! shout out to hard working officials

thoughts?
- dou e is trying to do whats obligated of her (filial piety etc) and it doesnt work out for her until karmic retribution after
