description:: discussing [[A Burial Mound for Flowers]]

##### Dream of the Red Chamber
- aka The Story of the Stone
- most famous novel written in china
- pinnacle of chinese vernacular literature
- one of the best stories ever written
- written by a guy anonymously first 80 chapters, finished by another guy 40 more chapters
- "so complex and so peopled with major and minor characters would be futile to summarize in a couple paragraphs"
- circulated among elites after its publications in 1750s-1760s
- many notes by contemporary readers about the novel
- printed in 1791

##### Cao Xuequin 1715?-1763?
- author
- born in nanjing
- family was members of the white banner (military/govt)
- ancestors were very important people
	- grandfather one of the emperors closest friends
	- grandmother was the emperors wetnurse
	- grandfather was the scholar for compilation of complete poems of the Qing(?) dynasty
- some think this was the reason Cao wrote the novel
	- to recapture some of the glory his family lost
- novel starts with a wealthy family and follows their downfall
	- some read this as autobiographical
- novel wasnt published in his lifetime
- fundamental differences between first 80 and last 40 chapters

##### The Basic Plot
- a stone requests the opportunity to live in the mundane world and is granted this wish, becomes a human
- baby boy is born with jade in his mouth
- thats why its called story of the stone
- this part isnt so relevant after the beginning
- but thats neat

##### Question of Authorship
- offers a window into meaning of the story
- novels were written anonymously / with pseudonyms
- by the time this novel comes out its much more respected to be doing
- ex when the water margin was written 400 years prior, not so respected

##### "Redology"
- works about rereading the text
- "Approaches to Teaching The Story of The Stone"
	- series of essays published regarding teaching this novel at the collegiate level
	- many ways to read the novel, many things to takeaway
	- like most important novels i guess
- has also been adapted into tv shows

##### Over 400 Characters
- a lot of characters!
- only ~30 that are really significant/important
- main trifecta
	- Jia Baoyu - the stone/main character
	- Lin Daiyu - Baoyus cousin/ideal love
	- Xue Baochai - Baoyus cousin/eventual wife

##### Reception
- Zhou Qi
	- "takes human feelings and social relations and locates them in the world of powder and rouge, the world of women..."
	- well received among women

##### Things to consider
- hows family presented
	- relationship between family members
	- between Jia Baoyu and his father/grandmother/etc
	- between family members and the servants
- how servants names are treated in translation
	- reasons to translate the servants names and not the main characters
- elite society and cultural capital
- status and privilege as a consort to the emperor
- cultural implication of reading within a text
- nature of orality vs reading

##### Burial Mound for Flowers
- jia baoyu's destiny is to be a high ranking official
- close relationship with emperor
- building a garden for eldest daughter(?)
	- she thinks its a waste to have a wonderful garden that no one can use but her
	- wants to give this garden over to her cousins including jia baoyu
- father isnt super down with it
- jia baoyu is called to meet with his father
- um i dont think im summarizing this right i missed some stuff
- weird stuff with servants
- names of servants have been translated but family members names arent
	- ex Bombarding Scent, Gold Bangle
	- dad is like, who is Bombarding Scent?
	- baoyu named the servants
	- get the feeling that these servants are subhuman to the family, their identity isnt constant
- father concerned that baoyu isnt studying for the imperial exams
	- hes gonna spend all his time in the garden slacking off
- baoyu is like 16-17 or smth
- planning to move into the garden
	- people are choosing places
	- picking auspicious dates to move in - thats important!
- people get bored
	- after moving in to the garden its all playing games and reading and painting and writing poems
	- not a lot of studying for the exams going on
	- idyllic life of leisure
- shows some poems
	- theyre not that good idk
- jia baoyu gets so upset and bored after a while he has a servant find him reading materials
	- but not classics he should be studying, he wants plays and poems and stuff
	- servant finds him [[Master Dong's Western Chamber Romance]]
	- starts reading this book
	- its shown that this is illicit behavior, not what he should be wasting his time on
- lin daiyu comes up to him and says what are you reading and she finds out
	- she reads it too
	- dangerous!
	- "theres a whole world of love she doesnt know about"
- gust of wind passes and a bunch of petals fall off a tree and jin baoyu says we should dump these into the river and watch them float down and lin daiyu says no what an ignominous way for these flowers to end we should bury the petals
	- thats where the title comes from and froeshadows lin daiyus death! rip
- intertextuality plays a big part in this
	- the mention of the western chamber - illicit relationships and vernacular culture
	- this book was written for fancy literary people
	- eventually escaped elite society and became something everyone enjoyed
- jia baoyu represented as adolescent and more feminine
-
