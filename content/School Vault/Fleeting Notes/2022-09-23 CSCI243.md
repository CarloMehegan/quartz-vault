today doing more induction proof examples and then moving into set theory

## Induction proof examples
##### Game of Hats
1. Room of $m$ people, all are wearing a hat
2. Each wears a blue or a red hat
3. Everyone can see each others hat but can't see their own
4. The number of blue hats is $n \geq 1$
5. Every step (1 minute or something) a bell rings and everyone who knows the color of their hat (from logical deduction) must call it out loud. No other exchange is allowed

Prove that all those with blue hats will call it at exactly the $n$th call (aka before $n$th ring , no one has said anything, until on the $n$th all blue hats call it)

Where do we start with this?
What variable do we induct on?
	$n$, because it doesn't matter how many ppl are in the room

Induction on $n$ (number of blue hats)
Base case
	(always start on the smallest $n$ you can use)
	$n = 1$
	this means there is one person with a blue hat, everyone else has a red hat
	the person wearing a blue hat only sees red hats, so they must be wearing a blue hat
	the people wearing red hats see one blue hat, so either they are wearing a red hat (total 1 b hat) or they are also wearing a blue hat (total 2 b hats)
	![[Pasted image 20220923111445.png]]
	at the first call, the b hat will call it ✔️
Inductive Hypothesis
	Assume always true for $n$ is equal to some $k$
	ie, Assume true for $k$ blue hats
	ie, if there are $k$ blue hats, all with blue hats will call it at $k$th step
Inductive Step
	Will prove for $k+1$ blue hats, they will all call it after $k+1$ steps.
	guys with red hats, think there are either $k+1$ or $k+2$ blue hats
	guys with blue hats, think there are either $k$ or $k+1$ blue hats
		they can eliminate one of these possibilities
		by IH, if there were $k$ blue hats, it would have been called at the $k$th step. so, after the $k$th step, if no one has called it, then there must be $k+1$ blue hats.
	his wording:
	From the IH, there cannot be $k$ blue hats because those with blue hats would have called it at the $k$th step.
	Since they didn't, the $k+1$ option is the only remaining choice.
	And all blue hat guys call it.

Will red hats ever call it first?
	the people with the red hats are playing the same game if $m-n \geq 1$
	they would just call it at the $m-n$ th step
	the game stops after $min(n, m-n)$
	so if there are more red hats than blue, then red will call it

Why does $n$ have to be greater than or equal to 1?
Base case
	if $n$ is allowed to be zero
	$n$ = 0, see only red hats
	so, there are either 0 or 1 blue hats
	they cannot eliminate either of these choices, so not possible

What if there are the same number of blue and red hats?
	everyone will call it at the same time

What if there is one red hat and everyone else is blue?
	red hat person calls it at the first step
	wait that doesnt make sense we didnt say $m \geq 1$ how do we know
	whatever blues will call it at nth step still

moving on to new topic


## Set Theory
##### Sets
A **set** is an **unordered** collection of **elements**.

Unordered
The set of 1 and 2 is the same as the set of 2 and 1

$x \in Y$ means element $x$ belongs in set $Y$
Usually use lowercase letters for elements and uppercase for sets

Can a set belong in a set?
Yes; supersets

Does a set belong to itself?
its about to get so annoying

##### Paradoxes
ex. Barber's Paradox
the barber shaves all men who do not shave themselves and only men who do not shave themselves.
who shaves the barber?
blah blah
he does not shave himself $\rightarrow$ he is shaved by the barber $\rightarrow$ he shaves himself $\rightarrow$ he is not a barber by definition $\rightarrow$ yeah etc

##### Russel's paradox
$Y  = {x | x \notin x}$
$Y \in Y \leftrightarrow Y \notin Y$

##### Basic definitions for sets
$S = {1, 2, 3}$
$Y = {'1', '2', '3'}$
$S \neq Y$

Special sets
	$\N$ (set of natural numbers), Z (set of integers), Q (set of rational numbers), R (set of real numbers). Superscript or subscript + is used for positive numbers. Superscript ∗ means the set does not include the zero.

Empty set
	denoted by $\emptyset$ or $\{ \}$
	Note that $\emptyset \neq \{ \emptyset \}$
