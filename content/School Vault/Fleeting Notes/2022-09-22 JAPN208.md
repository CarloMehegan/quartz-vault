##### Tourism in Interwar Japan: Rise of Mass Society
people traveling in and out of japan
yosano akiko was one of many who travelled in and out of japan
manchuria was a popular destination in interwar years
popular destinations then - korea, taiwan, hawaii, thailand, manchuria

history of tourism
- train service starts in 1870s
	- Tokyo-Yokohama (Bird took this train)
	- Kyoto-Osaka-Kobe
- Railway Nationalization Act
	- effective in 1907
	- "japan has one of the most extensive train networks in the world, started here"
- Japan Tourist Bureau
	- founded 1912
	- central agency for organized tourism
	- now a private company, was once govt funded
- industrialization and urbanization advances in post WWI era
	- growth of urban middle-class with disposable money
	- contributed to growth of tourism
- consumption stimulated by mass media
	- *Asahi Graph* (1923) magazine published by major newspaper
	- *King* (1924) targeted to middle class readers (sounds to me like NPR)
	- radio broadcasting started first in Tokyo and Osaka (1925)
- tourism popularized as a way of understanding the nation and empire in tangible manners
	- Dennis Merrill quore from *Negotiating Paradise: US Tourism and Empire in 20th Century Latin America*
		- talking about "tourist mentality" emerging in america after civil war
		- similar to what happened in japan
		- note that Yosano Akiko wasn't a "pioneer;" she was one of many travellers at the time

##### Manchuria
- many japanese businesses established in Manchuria after the Russo-Japanese War
- South Manchurian Railway Company, 1906
	- backed by japanese govt
	- involved in a variety of industries (steelworks, hotels, tourism)
- common tourist destination from the 1920s
	- JTB (japan tourist bureau) maintained multiple service centers
- **Manchuria imagined as a modern and cosmopolitan space**
	- think of Florida, California, NYC as common American tourist destinations
		- cities, beaches, grandeur, attractions, experiences

"the kind of trains Yosano Akiko would be riding on"
looks fun!
lots of western influence - the cities, inside of the train, the ports
"we tend to think modernization/westernization didnt start until after ww2"
many manchurian cities targeting tourism were modeled after western cities
manchuria was much easier to get to than the US/Europe
	and by 1930s america wasnt a friendly place for japanese tourists

quote from Louise Young in *Total Empire*
"attractions included not just the booming urban centers but everything from hunting, fishing, and mountain climbing regions to famous battle sites and archaeological wonders ... golf, horse racing ... "

##### Yosano Akiko 1878-1942
- famous japanese:
	- poet
	- feminist
	- translator from classical japanese
- married to Yosano Tekkan
	- poet, leader of japanese romantic movement, Myojo
	- translated *The Tale of Genji* into modern Japanese
- contributed to feminist journal Seito (Blue Stocking, 1911-1916)
- famous debate on "maternity protection" with Hiratsuka Raicho, 1918-1919
	- whether women need protection from the state, need special legal treatment, welfare
	- Raicho said yes
	- Akiko said no, because then we acknowledge women as inferior to men; women need to work like men
- traveled to Manchuria in 1928
	- funded by South Manchurian Railway
	- was not the first writer to travel to Manchuria sponsored by SMR
		- Natsume Soseki, 1909
		- shows SMR was eager to advertise tourism

##### questions to consider while reading [[Travels in Manchuria and Mongolia]]
- What did Yosano see in Manchuria? What did she not see?
- How does she interact with people in Manchuria?
- What sensibilities does Yosano have and how do they differ from Bird's or Fukuzawa's?
- Does she talk about Japan's colonialism? Is she a colonizer?
- How can we apply the concept of "contact zone"?

"last time we'll talk about contact zones, dont get too bored of it"
