description:: induction proof examples

last class working on proof by induction
base case, inductive step
or
base case, inductive hypothesis, inductive step

ex.
lets look at the baby gauss proof
$1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = \frac 1 2 n * (n + 1)$
im not gonna write it all actually

ex. 
at step 0, we have 1
at step 1, we have 2
we double it every step
prove that at step $k$ the number is $2^k$.

base case: 
	$k = 0$, $2^0 = 1$ true
inductive hypothesis:
	assume true for k, 
	after k step, number is $2^k$
inductive step;
	prove for the $k+1$ step (want to prove $2^k+1$ objects)
	from IH, at step $k$ number is $2^k$
	from definition of the problem, at $k+1$ the number is $2*2^k$
	$= 2^{k+1}$

ex.
prove that for any positive int $n$,
$n^3 + 2n$ is divisible by 3.

how would you go about proving without induction?
no clue

induction proof:
base case:
	$n=1$, then $1^3 + 2*1 = 3$, yes divisible by 3
IH:
	assume for any k, $k^3 + 2k$ is divisible by 3
	definition of "divisible by 3": $\exists c, k^3 + 2k = 3c$
IS:
	want to prove for $k+1$: want $\exists d : (k+1)^3 + 2(k+1) = 3d$
	$(k+1)^3 + 2(k+1) =$ distribute and stuff.,...
	$= k^3 + 3k^2 + 5k +3$
	$= (k^3 + 2k) + 3k^2 + 3k + 3$
	by inductive hypothesis, $(k^3 + 2k)$ is divisible by 3
	$= 3c + 3k^2 + 3k + 3$
	$= 3(c+k^2+k+1)$
	make it so $d = c + k^2 + k + 1$
	$= 3d$ 
	done

ex. Trominoes
dominoes are 2 squares
trominoes are 3 squares
tetrominoes are 4 squares
![[Pasted image 20220921113338.png]]
Tromino is an L-shaped figure of three squares
can be rotated

rules for the problem
- consider an n x n grid and a pile of trominoes
- pick any square of the grid and cut a hole in it (not to be used)
- can we tile the entire grid (except the cut tile) with trominoes?

trying out combinations to start
- 1x1 grid - does not work, 0 usable squares (or maybe you can say this is valid)
- 2x2 grid - works, 3 usable squares
- 3x3 grid - does not work, 8 usable squares
- 4x4 grid - works, 15 usable squares
- 5x5 grid - 24 usable squares, which is divisible by 3, but trominoes dont fit

.... eventually figure out that it works for grids where n is a power of 2
now let's prove this

prove that if $n = 2^k$ (n is a power of 2), $k = 1, 2, 3, ...$ then the tiling is possible

for proof, use variable that takes us from one step to the next, here it is k - we are inducting on k

Proof: use induction on k

Base case:
	k = 1
	2x2 grid, 3 usable squares, always works with one tromino
IH:
	assume that for any k,
	the grid with $2^k * 2^k$ squares (with a hole in it) is tilable
IS:
	prove for the next size $2^{k+1}*2^{k+1}$, tiling is possible (with a hole)
	think of 4 corners
	$2^{k+1}*2^{k+1}$ is 4 times the size of $2^k * 2^k$
![[Pasted image 20220921115138.png]]
	place 4 holes in each corner/quadrant, with 3 placed in such a way that a tromino can fill it
	each quadrant is tilable by IH
done
