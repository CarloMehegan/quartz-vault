description:: Six Dynasties period poets, Tao Qien, Xie Lingyun, The Mountains and Seas Classic

reading for today: poems from columbia reader

been talking about historical narrative
fiction and narrative storytelling

jumping forward a little
out of han dynasty and into next period, The Six Dynasties

##### The Six Dynasties and Utopia
The Six Dynasties 220-589
includes a lot of different political entities over these 400+ years, gets lumped together as a time of literary development

- Three Kingdoms 220-280
	- Wei vs Wu vs Shu
- Jin Dynasty 265-420
	- lots of argument about mandate of heaven
- Northern and Southern Dynasties 420-589
	- very tumultuous time, these empires didnt last very long
	- Liu Song 
	- Southern Qi
	- Liang
	- Chen

##### Tao Yuanming aka Tao Qian 365-427
descended from important officials
served as an official
constantly longed for the simple life
wanted to return to farming
ok stardew
acted as an official in 415 for only 3 months before returning to solitude
admired for sticking to his ideals
rejects the idea that one has to devote their life to the govt

##### Poems After Drinking Wine (No. 5)
first poem pg 77 in columbia reader
poems that romanticize drinking
"celebrate drinking as a way of collegiately getting along with friends"

	I built my hut beside a traveled road
	Yet hear no noise of passing carts and horses.

metaphorical, living without being distracted by whats around you
"mind detached"
dont need to move out into the mountains to become detached, need to detach your mind
Daoist idea, stepping away from the world

what do you think of this poem?
- finding peace internally not externally
- how well does the translation get the original ideas across
- similar to whitman poems
- style makes it seem he's talking directly to the reader (in translation at least)
- poem structure not so rigid
	- still structured, in original, 5 character couplets, rhyming
	- "form not changing significantly, subject is changing"
	- doesnt diverge much from literary norms at the time
- talking about nature, romanticizing nature, romanticizing being alone
- equating nature with peacefulness
	- "not making nature seem violent" or dangeroud
	- daoist idea of nature being dangerous, need to get out of its way

has a lot of poems with a similar flavor

##### On Reading *The Mountains and Seas Classic*
second poem
pg 79

*The Mountains and Seas Classic*
- presented as a geography, outside of china, fantastical countries
- early han dynasty maybe earlier

in the poem, a farmer
beyond the reach of officialdom

	This out-of-the-way lane has no deep-worn ruts
	And tends to turn my friends' carts away.

romanticizing solitude
idyllic weather, no one around

	I skip through the *Story of King Mu*
	And view the pictures in the *Mountains and Seas Classic*
	A glance encompasses the ends of the universe --
	Where is there any joy, if not in these?

sitting back and reading
"yeah this is awesome"

thoughts?
- calm and idyllic, political atmosphere must be better, or there is a desire to get away from politics
- contrasts from how it would be to serve as an official
- no explicit lesson, just vibing
- Stardew Valley evokes similar feelings
- observant of nature

Tao Qian is known for this aloofness

##### The Return
third poem
pg 235

an essay with a poem appended to it
one can be known through their poetry
poems further express the emotion behind the writing

here, Tao Qian describing his life and how it is
poor, thought of becoming a magistrate, didnt wanna
had connections, and was offered a job, didnt wanna go
took the job, after a month or two, says this isnt for me
stayed in the position because it was comfortable
realized he was compromising his principles, gives up the job
then a poem
could see the prose as a preface to the poem

	My field and garden will be overgrown with weeds --
	I must go back.

his farm hasnt been cared for while he was out working, he wants to return
he gets back and is happy
autobiographical
rather than expressing a single moment in time, expressing a series of ideals

thoughts?
- do you see the same voice behind this poem as the others?
	- has a more poetic tone, this one is more autobiographical, like a diary
- flow of consciousnees rather than a structured poem
- it feels like he's older in this poem
- like he's at the end of his life, at peace
	- this is a choice i made and im content with it


these poems are not the first thing people think of when they think of Tao Qian, they think of the next poem
one of the most famous of these kinds of these poems, take on utopia

##### The Peach Blossom Spring
fourth poem
pg 364
starts with prose again, followed by a poem

a fisherman stumbling across a utopia
often where you hear these stories about finding utopia, it's always stumbling in, never found when trying actively to find it
daoist idea?

in the utopia
nice things
growing crops
livestock
sense of abundance, activity
people enjoying things

they tell the man that their ancestors had fled the disorders of the Ch'in dynasty (Qin in modern pinyin)
~600 years have passed
lost all contact about the outside world
excited listening to the fisherman explain what has happened in history since then, the dynasties that have passed
idea that utopia is focused on how people acted in the past
"living in accordance with the Dao, just hanging out"

fisherman leaves and tells the magistrate about it, people go looking for it, cant find it

"one of the fascinating things about this piece is you have this prose piece, then you have a poem following that lays out what happened and moralizes it"
followed by a poem

	Although they had no calendar to tell,
	The four seasons still filled out a year.

against the idea of the calendar, sacred at the time, emperor maintained the calendar, everyone followed the calendar, etc
they didnt need a calendar, they knew when each season came as the weather changed
nature knows, we dont need to stress about it
very daoist idea

	Joyous in their ample happiness,
	They had no need of clever contrivance.

probably his most famous poem

thoughts?
- interesting social commentary at the time
- what inspires someone to write about utopia like this?
- not necessarily advocating for daoism specifically, but describing results of a community that ascribes to it
- what do you think of the poem as an encapsulation of the prose's story?


now lets talk about Xie Lingyun

##### Xie Lingyun 385-433
"kind of a controversial figure, poems are difficult to read"
he was a bhuddist
had difficult struggles politically
on the wrong side of imperial opinion
served in govt for 20 years
found himself on losing side of succession battle, exiled to some local job, resigned, moved to family estate, spent a lot of time writing in the mountains
couldnt keep his opinions to himself, banished further, tried to start a rebellion, failed, banished further, eventually executed
considered the first landscape poet

"likes to show off his vocabulary, some of his poems are long lists of nouns"


##### On My Way from South Mountain to North Mountain, I Glance at the Scenery from the Lake
pg 80 in columbia reader

many of his poems set from a viewpoint of transit
a journey
he's walking here

juxtaposition of things that are close and things that are far
ex. leaning against lush pines as he turns his eyes upon distant sandbars

poem is really just describing the nature around him
doesnt have a conflict, resolution, moral, just very descriptive

thought?
- descriptive
- less focus on the self
	- how do i fit into nature vs. the person is a vessel, observer
	- not living in nature like Tao Qian
	- "he was quite wealthy, his family lands were pretty extensive"
	- mf was just walking around his backyard
	- important to realize, how nature is described, and how people fit in it


more poems we didnt have as readings but still interesting

##### I've Put in Gardens South of the Fields
"idea one almost has to carve out the beauty of nature to make it ideal"
like a landscaped garden, lot of effort to show nature while limiting the wild stuff

feng shui
- how old is feng shui? super old


##### Dwelling in the Mountains
one of the poems thats mostly just nouns
series of poems called dwelling in the mountains, in poem 24
trout perch trent red eye sturgeon carp mandarin fish flying fish bass...........
just keeps listing types of fish he sees

what do you make of this style of poetry?
- red fish blue fish
- starts with listing, then describes what they were doing

this style is common for him, not all as egregious

next poem is worse though
there are birds like swan esprey thrush turkey ducks pheasants seabirds northern birds ................
says a bunch more that i dont even know
and lists a bunch of mammals

not much interstitial commentary, just talking about wildlife

any other thoughts?
- short and sweet just descriptive not much fluff
- showing off his erudition
- expressing the grandeur of the land he's in
- many of the poems give off a minimalistic feeling, maybe because of the translation
- is this escapism?
-
