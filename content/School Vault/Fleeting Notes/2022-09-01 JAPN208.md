course description
>This course examines travel, migration, occupation, and other cross-border movements between Japan and the world in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We ask the meanings of such cross-border movements, taking them as acts that reflect critical issues related to the nation-state, civilizations, capitalism, colonialism and imperialism, war, citizenship, and so forth. Living under the influence of the Enlightenment, we tend to believe that we can make autonomous decisions about our lives, and therefore view cross-border movements as personal matters. It is important for us, however, to consider these movements in historical contexts and interrogate what forces produced the desire and the impulse to cross borders.

three modules
1. the politics of travel - readings from travelers
2. migration, citizenship, and identity - japanese migrants in the us, etc
3. occupation and knowledge production - us occupation in japan 1945 - 1952, esp. okinawa 1945 - 1972

primary goals
- general history of cross border movements
- familiarize ourselves with major readings
- gain skills to analyze these writings
- sytnthesize knowledge and skills thus earned to construct an original argument
