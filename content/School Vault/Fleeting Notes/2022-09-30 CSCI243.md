description:: functions, mapping

zoom class again its awesome
started with proving whatever we were working on last class, finishing sets

## Functions
A function $f : A \rightarrow B$
is a mapping of each element in set $A$ to some element in set $B$. $A$ is called the **domain** of $f$ and $B$ is called the **codomain** of $f$.

- Note that the arrow does not mean implication!

- takes elements of A and maps them onto elements of B
- so what does that mean

The set $\{f(a)|a \in A\}$ is a subset of $B$ and is called the **range** of $f$.

To generalize to multi-variables, function $f : A_1 \times A_2 \times ... \times A_n \rightarrow B$ is a mapping of each ordered $n$-tuple to some element in $B$.


##### Injective, Subjective, Bijective
Function $f : A \rightarrow B$ is **injective**, or **one-to-one**, or **1-1**, iff
$f (a) = f (b) \rightarrow a = b, \forall a, b \in A$
That is, there are no different values in $A$ that are mapped to the same value in $B$
- important remember vertical line rule from like middle school when checking if a function is a proper function

Function $f$ is **surjective**, or **onto**, iff the range of $f$ coincides with its codomain
$\forall b \in B \exists a \in A : b = f(a)$
- range of f conincides with codomain means all elements of A map to something
- note fig. 3 and 4 below are both onto

Function $f$ is **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective
- one to one, and onto
- each element of A maps to its own element of B
- A and B have the same number of elements, and each maps to an element
- see fig. 4 below

fig. 1
a function, but not 1-1/injective

fig. 2
a function, injective

fig. 3
a function, not injective, surjective

fig. 4
a function, injective and surjective, so bijective

if A has n elements and B has m elements
and n > m
then function cant exist


##### Inverse of a function
For a 1-1 function $f : A \rightarrow B$, its inverse is defined to be
$f^{-1} : B \rightarrow A$, where $f^{-1}(b) = a$ when $f(a) = b$.

all elements of B have to be mapped to in $f$
otherwise in $f^{-1}$, elements wont have something to map to = not a function
etc


##### Composition function
$f: A \rightarrow B$ and $g : B \rightarrow C$. Then define composition function as
$g \circ f : A \rightarrow C$, with $g \circ f(a) = g(f(a))$

Note that if $f$ is bijective (ie inverse exists) then
$f \circ f^{-1} = 1_{B \rightarrow B}$ the identity function on B
and
$f^{-1} \circ f = 1_{A \rightarrow A}$ the identity on A


##### Increasing, Decreasing
types of functions

Monotonic Increasing/Decreasing
- goes in one direction for the entire duration
- $f(x_1) \leq f(x_2)$


##### In Computer Science
some common functions used in computer science
- ceiling and floor rounding
- modular arithmetic
- polynomials
- exponentials
- logarithms
- factorials
see lecture notes page 21 for examples and stuff and function notation
