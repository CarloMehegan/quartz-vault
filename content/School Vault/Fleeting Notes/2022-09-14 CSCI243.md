description:: fallacies, quantifier laws, methods of proof

question: do you only need one example to prove a proposition is false
$\forall x P(x)$
for all x i give, P(x) is true
is it enough to give an example to prove this - no need more
if you want to prove it is false, one example is fine - thats all you need
so if proving false then $\neg (\forall x P(x))$ would be true and 
with de morgan law $\equiv \exists x \neg P(x)$ need to prove this now

and the other way around
$\exists x P(x)$ disproving this can be done with one example
etc

lecture start

## Fallacies
using "rules" that resemble tautologies
tautology = propositional function which is always true

"look like tautologies but are not"
"im making mistakes of logic here"

##### Fallacy of affirming the conclusion
$((p \rightarrow q) \bigwedge q) \rightarrow p$
if p is false and q is true
then $p \rightarrow q$ is true and q is true $((p \rightarrow q) \bigwedge q)$ is true
now we have $T \rightarrow F$ which is $F$

ex. if i download illegal music then there is music on my hard drive
true theorem there is music downloaded
just because there is music on a hard drive doesnt mean that it is illegal

"correlation means whenever i see one thing by and large i see another thing at the same time"
"is there a causation?" no not always

##### Fallacy of denying the hypothesis
"20% of the class always makes this mistake on the final!"

$((p \rightarrow q) \bigwedge \neg p) \rightarrow \neg q$

p is i open the spigot
q is there is water in the backyard
if p implies q and p is not true then q must not be true
if spigot means water and i didnt open the spigot then theres no water
not true!

"instead of denying the conclusion we deny the hypothesis and that is wrong"

ex. if i download illegal music then there is music on my hard drive
now assume i did not download illegal music
does this mean my drive does not have music? no!

## Rules of Inference for quantifiers
"i dont wanna spend so much time on this you guys will probably find this simple"

##### Universal instantiation
$\forall x P(x) \rightarrow P(c)$
c represents a number
generalization is P(c) is true for an arbitrary c $\rightarrow \forall x P (x)$
because c represents any number then "for all x" should follow the same suit

this is what we use to prove these statements

##### Existential instantiation
$\exists x P(x) \rightarrow P(c)$ true for some c

sidenote: can be more than one exists
"there exists a fruit that is sour" there are many sour fruit

generalization P(c) for some c $\rightarrow \exists x P(x)$

##### Universal Modus Ponens
"theres no e on the end of ponens the notes are wrong"

using rules of inference
$\forall x (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x))$
$P(c)$
$=$
$Q(c)$

##### Universal Modus Tollens
$\forall x (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x))$
$\neg Q(c)$
$=$
$\neg P(c)$

(not the same for existential modus ponens/modus tollens)

##### why are we doing all this?
so we can have proofs
we can start proving things using these tools


## Methods of Proofs
proof
	a sequence of statements, where each statement is given condition or conclusion obtained by previous statements *by some rules of inference*

![[Pasted image 20220914113352.png]]

"focusing now on, how can we make arguments where we go one step to the next using the rules of inference"
"you have to use rules of inference"
"many techniques/methods, which ones to use depends on problem"

#quote "what we will try to do throughout this class is build an intuition for which methods you need for proofs"
"need to do a lot of examples to build intuition"

##### 1. Direct Proof
To prove if p then q,
Need to assume p is true (starting point), p holds
Show q is true in a direct set of steps

ex. Prove that if $m$ and $n$ are odd integers, then so is $m * n$.

"i would start by putting a couple numbers in there and see if it holds"
	3 x 5 = 15
	7 x 7 = 49
	5 x 5 = 25
	1 x 9 = 9
	"ok seems like it holds now lets try to prove this for all m and n"
first thing is translate p/what is given into something you can use
	assume m, n odd
	what does "odd" mean mathematically?
	by definition of odd numbers,
		$\exists a : m = 2a+1$
		m is an odd number
		$\exists b : n = 2b+1$
		n is an odd number
	note: scope is integers
what do we do next? "let the conclusion drive your next step"
want to prove $m*n$ is odd, so lets multiply our new definitions of $m*n$
	$m*n = (2a + 1)*(2b + 1)$
	$= 4ab + 2a + 2b + 1$
now what? show this is odd, show this can be put in form $2a + 1$
	$= 2(2ab + a + b) + 1$
let's define $c = 2ab + a + b$
	$mn = 2c + 1$
which is the definition of an odd number.

##### 2. Proof by Contraposition
"dont have much time left so ill mention it and then we'll spend who knows how many lectures talking about this"

if p then q, assume q is false
(again never assume hypothesis is wrong)
and prove that p is also false
$p \rightarrow q \equiv \neg q \rightarrow \neg p$
