## CRC Cards in Object-Oriented Design

CRC Cards
- OO design is iterative
	- need a flexible, light weight technology to descibe a design
- CRC = Classes, Responsibilities, Collaborators
- Concept
	- Index cards
	- Class name at the top of the card
	- Responsibilities on the left
	- Collaborators on the right
- It is small, rugged, low tech...
	- index cards are small, thats on purpose, should stay simple

Responsibilities
- Responsibilities should be **high level**
- **1-3** responsibilities per card
- Shouldn't have a lot!

Collaborators
- Collaborators are for the class, not for each responsibility
- List them in any order
- Shouldn't have a lot!

Tips
- Avoid extremes
- Too much
	- Beware the omnipotent system class
	- Avoid mission creep. Do not heap too much on one class.
	- Watch our for unrelated responsibilities
	- Do not add functionality that isnt required
- Too little
	- A class with no responsibilities is not useful
- Use CRC to inform, not to design
- Dont have a single monster card
- Omit inessential details

Walkthroughs
- What to do once CRC Cards look fine? Walkthrough Use Cases
- Use case: "Leave a message"
	- Caller connects to voice mail system
	- Called dials extension number
	- "Someone" must locate mailbox, but neither Mailbox nor Message can do this
	- $\rightarrow$ new class: MailSystem
	- $\rightarrow$ responsibility: manage mailboxes
