description:: Tang Dynasty poets, Wang Wei, Bai Juyi, Meng Chiao, Hsueh Tao

talking about various poets and interesting poetry
last time talked about autobiographical nature, relationship with daoism and buddhism, will see more of that today
people will say that this is where most chinese literature classes spend their time

##### Wang Wei 699-759
- known for both his poetry and his paintings
- wrote a lot of poems
	- pattern we've seen, these poets write like hundreds, thousands of poems
	- some poems attributed to him are fakes
	- people will impersonate a famous poet to get their work out
- some of his poems preserved by the govt, 10 poems make up (some collection i didnt hear)
- passed the imperial exams when he was 22

sidenote: the exams
##### The Imperial Exams
- during Tang dynasty, establishment of civil service exams
- series of exams designed to place people in positions in the govt
- once established by the tang dynasty, stays a common practice in one form or another until 1906
- first level - provincial level - imperial level
- if you pass imperial exam you are a top scholar
- what made up the exam?
	- essays based on the nature of confucian thought
	- poetry
- positive feedback loop
	- meta strat was to write essays based on ideas the examiners liked
- in later periods, over abundance of intellectual people trying to take the exam, becomes competitive
- people spend their entire careers going to the capital taking the exams again and again

##### Wang Wei cont
back to wang wei
- passes exam at 22
	- renessaince man
	- at the pinnacle of official success
	- already popular for his poetry
	- appointed as court musician
	- soon after he offended someone and was sent to run a granary
	- works his way back up, demoted again when one of his friends upsets the emperor
	- captured by An Lushan rebellion
	- pretended he was deaf, drank poison to destroy his voice
	- still arrested when he got back to the empire because he was suspected to be a traitor
	- his brother became an important official and got him pardoned
- his poetry
	- bhuddist aesthetic
	- most were quatrains; short poems
	- quatrains: 4 couplets of 5 characters
- Climbing Pien-chueh Temple
	- bhuddist setting
	- "nice little scene where people are getting together and practicing buddhism"
	- by this time, rapid expansion/popularity of buddhism
- Second Song for the Worship of the Goddess at Yu Mountain: "Bidding the Goddess Farewell"
	- nature
	- mysticism
	- buddhist, bc we know he was buddhist, but could be daoist
		- whats the difference?
		- "in cases with a lot of discussion of enlightenment, being along in nature, without necessarily calls to Buddhist jargon, difficult to distinguish Daoist from Buddhist"
		- Buddhism in china is very influenced by Daoism
		- "buddhism involves moving beyond the world in a way daoism doesnt imply"
- Deer Enclosure
	- empty mountain, but still hears the echoes of someones voice
	- very short poem
- Army Ballad
	- very different tone
	- "the bugle blows, setting the marchers moving," 
	- glorification of war?
	- "sounds of battle within the dust and mist"
	- mundaneity of war?
	- is this from when he was captured/in reference to it?


##### Bai Juyi 772-846
- latest of the Tang poets we'll mention specifically
- born at the end of the An Lushan rebellion, period where people perceived that the Tang dynasty was on decline, past its prime
	- official in the Tang govt, wrote a lot of poetry centered around being an official
	- his brother wrote short stories
	- came from a poor family with a strong emphasis on education
	- social mobility was possible through the civil service exam
	- takes up position in the capital at 28
	- becomes buddies with [[2022-10-05 CHIN309#Yuan Zhen 779-831|Yuan Zhen]]
	- political whatever i missed it
	- retires
- his poetry
	- simple to understand, simple to translate
	- what happens when someone takes current events and turns them into a poem?
	- wrote a lot about things that recently happened
- The Song of Lasting Regret
	- about the relationship between the Emperor Hsuan Tsung and Lady Yang (missed her name) (Yang Guifei got it) and how it led to the An Lushan rebellion
		- emperor falls in love with this girl
		- starts neglecting imperial duties
		- he starts giving more and more power to a distant cousin of Lady Yang
		- An Lushan is accumulating power on the corners of the empire
		- rebellion happens emperor and party flee the capital
		- soldiers mutiny while fleeing, kill the distant cousin, and tell the emperor they wont continue unless they put Lady Yang to death too for causing this, he eventually does
		- later they are able to go back to the capital and his son becomes emperor and whatever
	- poem set in Han dynasty, but everybody knows who this is about
	- retells this story
	- "lot of cross cultural pollination happening at the time"
		- someone asked if Yang Guifei was Han Chinese or some other ethnicity and it seems she is but even if she wasnt thats surprisingly not something that would have really mattered at this time
	- these events happened like ~40 years ago when this was written
	- kind of a dangerous thing to write about
