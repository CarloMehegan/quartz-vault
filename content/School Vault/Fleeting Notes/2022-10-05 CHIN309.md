description:: Tang Dynasty writers, Li Gongzuo, Yuan Zhen, Story of Ying-ying

last time talked about poetry, utopia, environment
this time talking about two classical language short stories
moving into the tang dynasty

##### The Tang Dynasty 618-907
- the high tang 
	- talking about poetry written up to the _ rebellion
	- time of great writing

##### Tales of the Strange and the Origins of Fiction
- starting to write completely fictional stories
- before this weve seen writing about history with fictional elements, these elements interpreted as having a deeper meaning, metaphorical
- self consciously fictional: telling a story, for the fun of it
- cultural influence
	- historical indian influence
- retold in many different forms over time

##### Li Gongzuo 778-848
- chinese writer
- wrote some of these tales of the strange
- prototypical stories, going on to influence other fiction
- wrote the story we're about to talk about

##### An Account of the Governor of the Southern Branch
- by Li Gongzuo
- initial thoughts
	- different from what we've read
	- how are expectations of stories like this different from others?
		- not much established structure, previous work, established tropes
	- another drunken main character like Kao-Tsu in [[Records of the Grand Historian]]
- the story
	- starts talking about how this guy is not cool
	- drinks too much goes around righting wrongs as he sees fit
		- is this guy batman
		- also doesnt seem to have best judgement of character
		- described later on as "a knight-errant"
	- expectation that this guy is at the bottom, he will get better as story goes on
		- "hit harder ~15 years ago before unlikeable main characters became popular"
	- havent talked much about how people rise through power
		- civilians - pass imperial exams, gain important positions, culturedness
		- military - go up the ranks in the military due to strength
	- strong tendency to place things both in time and geographically
		- story says it takes place in 791 a few miles of some town, gives a description of what the area looks like
		- becomes a standard, almost a trope in chinese writing
	- we know that at the end he's dreaming of himself in a kingdom of insects
		- ok so this dude isn't batman he's hollow knight
		- The Great Nation of Locust Tranquility
	- stuff happens
	- marriage ceremony
		- very lavish
		- "Lady Flowery Slope, another Ms. Green Stream, another Higher Transcendent, another Lower Transcendent"
		- "daoist names"
	- he becomes governor of the southern branch
		- sets out to take on the job
		- writes a memorial and asks king for his friends to come along with him
		- memorial's language mimics how memorials were really written then
		- moving faster
		- hes governor
		- hes good at it
		- king becomes worried hes too good
		- sends his friend to fight the Nation of Sandalwood Creepers, he loses
		- gains more power
		- resigns from position, moves back to the capital
		- still gained power
	- wakes up
		- passes years of his life in this dream and wakes up
		- him and his buddy finds the tree he thinks he was living in and finds two big ants, the king and the queen, and destroys the kingdom (an anthole)
		- it was the big locust tree described at the beginning of the story
	- died at age 47, just like dad predicted when hed see him in his dream (oh yeah i didnt write that but his dad is there)
	- pretense of framing this as history at the end
		- saying it was a true story written down by the author who met the main character on a trip

##### Yuan Zhen 779-831
- wrote the next story
- writer
- had positions in govt
- very famous as a close friend of another poet we'll read later

##### The Story of Ying-ying
- Think about: why was this story so compelling? why is it rewritten so much later? "fanfics"
- Young man named Chang
	- traditional protagonist
	- cool good guy
	- "gotten to be 23 years old without ever having had relations with a woman"
	- says he hasnt met the right girl
	- "personality of this character is gonna emerge in some interesting ways"
	- white knight nice guy
	- "not super humble"
	- "queer subtext"
		- "not generally a problem to be queer in Tang dynasty as long as you try to have kids"
		- oh real
	- "not like other guys" and the girl later is "not like other girls"
		- "manic pixie dream girl"
- some military skirmish, Chang has local officer friends that he gets to help protect ppl at the monastery he's staying in
	- "this paragraph in later retellings becomes like 70% of the story"
	- shows political instability at this time
- Mrs. Ts'ui, one of the people whose lives he saved
	- invites him to banquet
	- "your widowed aunt" 
	- introduces Chang to her children as their elder brother
- Chang meets daughter
	- he goes insane 4 her
	- she's not like other girls
	- she doesnt wanna be there
	- shes 17
- Maid of Ying-ying becomes go between for her and Chang
	- Chang tries to get her to help him get Ying-ying
	- she doesnt want to goes against propriety
	- says he's literally going crazy for this girl
	- "I was hardly able to control myself"
	- ok man
	- he doesnt even know her, just saw her
	- Maid's name is sometimes translated as Crimson, her name becomes a word for the go-between during wedding arrangements, that's how famous the story is
- Maid tells him that she notices that she writes a lot, he could seduce her with a love poem
	- In this version of the story, we never see Chang's poetry, but we see Ying-ying's
	- She writes a romantic poem inviting him to see her
		- doesnt seem very characteristic based on what we know so far
- Chang climbs up apricot tree to see her
	- wakes up maid, shes like wtf, he says oh she told me to be here
		- over-reading of what the poem really says
	- she shows up
		- shes like wtf thanks for saving us but now youre being weird i wasnt gonna do anything about it but after your poem i had to write something to get you to over here so i could yell at you
	- he leaves
- And then they get together a few days later
	- she doesnt say anything for ten days
	- hes like ok i cant hang around forever
- he has to head off, comes back a few months later
- she plays a zither not knowing Chang can hear her
	- image of refinement that she can play this zither, she's very smart
	- when Chang tries to talk to her, she stops playing, Chang becomes more infatuated
- yeah he had to leave to take exams, still no formalization of their relationship despite of what mother wants
	- she says cmon youre not gonna marry me 
	- why isnt he
- she plays "Rainbow Robe and Feather Skirt"
	- lost song today
- he leaves
- writes a letter to her to reassure her 
	- shows letter to his friend
	- authorial insert
	- adds a long poem about the events
- also shes referred to as Ms. Ts'ui in the reading i didnt say that
	- her name isnt said until the end
- after spending time in capital, decides shes too beautiful, would ruin her, ruin the country, decides he's done with her
- people hated this ending!
- so there's rewrite after rewrite where they do get together
- "theres so much wrong with this with how theyre acting and how they should be acting"
- did the author do it to drum up drama?
- leads to many new versions that make people happier

thoughts
- does the author mean for us to think Chang is in the right?
- seems realistic, people move out and fall out of love
- can see why people hate the ending, not convincing, seems like author isnt even convinced by ending
- not like an external circumstance keeping them together, its him being weird
- he chooses his job over her, but doesnt really feel justified
