## Predicate
A predicate is a statement with variables. It can be either true or false depending on the values assigned to the variables.

$P(x)$ is an often way to denote a predicate. Uppercase is typically used for predicates, while lowercase is used for [[Proposition|Propositions]].

Logical operations defined for propositions can all be applied to predicates to get compound predicates.

A predicate can involve many variables. A predicate with $n$ variables $P(x_1, x_2, ... , x_n)$ is called a $n$-place predicate or $n$-ary predicate.

##### notation
$P(x) = x > 3$
$Q(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$
may be defined with the notation
"let $Q(x,y)$ be the predicate $x^2 + y^2 = 4$"


If we want to express the extent to which a predicate is true over a range of elements, we use [[Quantifier|Quantifiers]].
