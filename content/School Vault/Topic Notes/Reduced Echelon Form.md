## Reduced Echelon Form

A [[Matrix]] in [[Echelon Form]] is considered in Reduced Echelon Form if it satisfies the following conditions:
1. The leading entry in each nonzero row is 1.
2. Each leading 1 is the only nonzero entry in its column.

Also called Reduced Row Echelon Form

A matrix in this form is called a Reduced Echelon Matrix

A method to row reduce a matrix into a Reduced Echelon Matrix is the [[Row Reduction Algorithm]]. Reducing a matrix to Reduced Echelon Form is done in order to find the solution set of its corresponding [[Linear System]].

All nonzero matrices can be row reduced into more than one matrix in echelon form using [[Elementary Row Operations]]. However, the reduced echelon form one obtains from a matrix is [[Uniqueness#Theorem Uniqueness of the Reduced Echelon Form|Unique]].
