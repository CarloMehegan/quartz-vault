## Pivot Position

A Pivot Position in a [[Matrix]] A is a location in A that corresponds to a leading 1 in the reduced echelon form of A.
A Pivot Column is a column of A that contains a pivot position.

After using [[Elementary Row Operations]] to put the matrix into [[Echelon Form]], we can see that the nonzero rows' [[Leading Entry|Leading Entries]] have revealed the Pivot Positions.

On the original matrix, we can see where the Pivot Positions and Pivot Columns are.


A Pivot is a nonzero number in a pivot position that is used as needed to create zeroes via row operations.

Pivot Positions are used in order to find a linear system's solution set with the [[Row Reduction Algorithm]].
