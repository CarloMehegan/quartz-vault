## Parametric Description

Parametric Description is a format used to display the solution set of a [[Linear System]].

This is an example of a *parametric description of a solution set*.

Each variable in the linear system is defined with an equation composed of constants and [[Free Variable|Free Variables]]. In the example above. $x_3$ is a free variable, and is listed as such. Each choice of $x_3$ determines a (different) solution of the system, and every solution of the system is determined by a choice of $x_3$. 

"To be consistent, we make the (arbitrary) convention of always using the free variables as the parameters for describing a solution set" (page 20).
