## Implication
see: [[Logical Operator]]

Implication is a binary logical operator that gets its own page because it's complicated

Analogy - turning on the spigot in the backyard
p = turning on the spigot
q = water in the backyard
- (T-T = T) If I turn on the spigot, then there will be water in the backyard
- (F-F = T) If I don't turn on the spigot, then there will be no water in the backyard
- (F-T = T) If I don't turn on the spigot, and there is water in the backyard, this doesn't mean our logic has broken; it may have just rained
- (T-F = F) If I turn on the spigot, and there is no water in the backyard, something is wrong

If p is present, then q is always present
If q is present, p is not necessarily present
