## Consistence

A [[Linear System]] is consistent if it has a solution set. If it does not, it is inconsistent.

One way of finding inconsistence is if a zero row in a augmented matrix has a nonzero number *b* in the rightmost column. This equates to *b* = 0, which cannot be true.

A linear system can be:
1. Inconsistent; no solutions
2. Consistent and [[Uniqueness|Unique]]; one solution
3. Consistent and not Unique; multiple/infinitely many solutions
