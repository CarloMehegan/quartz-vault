[[Russian folklore]]

Reading for CS100 Feb 7



King has three grown sons
"Each of you shoot an arrow and she who brings back your arrow will be your bride"
"He whose arrow is not brought back will not marry"

Two elder sons' arrows were brought by a prince's daughter and a general's daughter
Youngest son, prince Ivan's arrow, was brought back by a frog

"His brothers were joyous and happy, but Prince Ivan became thoughtful and wept"
yeah fair

They all got married to their brides

King wants the three brides to make him gifts

In the night the frog goes out onto the street and casts off her skin and turns into a lovely maiden

Frog girl makes the best gift, the two elder sons are mad

It happened again but they all make bread this time

And again but this time they have to dance at a ball
Also the frog girl tricks the other wives into embarrassing themselves
Also the frog girl does some magic

The prince finds the skin the frog girl shed and burned it and now she's just girl

That night the princess vanishes

Time skip a couple years Ivan goes looking for her

He talks to a hut in the same way the guy talked to the goldfish

He's looking for "Elena the Fair"

I think he's asking Baba Yaga where she is also doesn't Baba Yaga have two sisters or something anyways now he has to go the middle sister

Middle sister says she is marrying someone else and the wedding is soon, and she is living with the eldest sister. There's some convoluted thing about how Elena will turn into a spindle when he gets near and he has to break the spindle to make her appear

He breaks the spindle or whatever and Elena is so happy to see him they take the eldest sister's magic carpet and fly away

They cross the border into Russia and can't be followed across the border by Elena's almost groom and then they live happily ever after




Connections to [[The Goldfish]]
- Is Ivan the only one who sees his wife as a frog? Maybe in the goldfish, the wife wasn't evil and the husband was, we only saw his persepctive and he was lying
- When Ivan talks to the hut it sounds a lot like the chant that the man used to summon the goldfish

Connections to [[Vasilisa the Beautiful]] 
- Baba Yaga makes an appearance
- Baba Yaga is not in Russia? Was she not in Russia last time either?
