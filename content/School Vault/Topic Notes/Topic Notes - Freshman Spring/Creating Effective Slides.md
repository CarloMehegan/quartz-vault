# Creating Effective Slides
Jean-luc Doumont on April 4, 2013 - Clark Center Stanford University

- Get your audience to / pay attention to / understand / be able to act upon/ a message
- If you have to make a presentation at 1 o’clock and it is 9 in the morning, forget about slides
- A template is not a logo and a footer and a blue band that wastes so much space on top of that, a template is a way to specify where the content should come and how the content should look once it comes there. That means as long as you don’t have content, there should be nothing
- Don’t put the logo on each page but only on the first and latest page
- A wonderful test of readability: print your own slides before you give the talk (on handouts) six per pages
- Using a laser pointer hinders you of impressing the audience with your body

effective redundancy
- if someone doesnt understand whats on the slide, they can listen to what youre saying
- if someone doesnt understand what youre saying, they can read whats on the slide
