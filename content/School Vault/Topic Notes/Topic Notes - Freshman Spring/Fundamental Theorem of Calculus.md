# Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

### Synopsis
The FTC is split into two parts, and the theorem is used to solve integrals using differentiation techniques.

FTC part 1 shows that integration and differentiation are inverse operations.
FTC part 2 shows that [[Antiderivatives]] can be used to solve an integration.

### Detailed Definition
*FTC Part 1:*
	If f is [[continuous]] on the closed interval \[a, b\], then the function g defined by
$$
\displaystyle g(x) = \int_{a }^{x }f(t)dt , a \leq x \leq b
$$
	is continuous on \[a, b\] and differentiable on (a, b), and **g'(x) = f(x)**.

*FTC Part 2:*
	If f is [[continuous]] on the closed interval \[a, b\], then
$$
\displaystyle \int_{a }^{b}f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$
	where F is any [[Antiderivatives|antiderivative]] of f, that is, a function such that F' = f.
