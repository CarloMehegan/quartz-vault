# Phonetics II
### Phonetic Transcription
- Universal, can be used for multiple languages
- Removes pronunciation ambiguity from words that are spelled weird
- Helps preserve accent; shows the exact sound
	- US vs UK "car"
- 1:1 correspondence between symbols and sounds
- To show sounds and distinguish from letters, use brackets

### Consonants
Starting with American consonants
##### Consonants: Parameters for articulation
1. Voicing (voiceless on the left and voiced on the right)
2. Place of articulation (sorted by column)
3. Manner of articulation (sorted by row)

![[Consonant Chart for American English.png]]

How to read chart
$[d]$ = voiced alveolar stop
$[n]$ = voiced alveolar nasal

##### Consonants: Places of articulation (and notable sounds)
Bilabial 
	- lips
Labiodental 
	- lips and teeth
Interdental/dental 
	- tongue between/behind teeth
	- $[θ]$ = "thhh," voiceless
	- $[ð]$ = "thhu," voiced
Alveolar 
	- common articulator in English
Post Alveolar
	- $[ʃ]$ = esh symbol = "shhh," voiceless
	- $[ʒ]$ = "zhhh," voiced, buzzier, like in "treasure"
Palatal
	- $[j]$ = "yuh"
Velar
	- $[g]$ = "guh" = back of throat
Glottal
	- $[ʔ]$ = glottal stop = as in "uh-oh"

##### Consonants: Manners of articulation (and notable sounds)
Stops
	- aka plosives
	- stops air from coming out
	- buh, tuh, guh, puh, glottal stop, etc
Fricatives
	- common in English
	- ffff, sssss, vvvv, shhhh, thhh, zzzz,
	- "friction" on the constriction of air
Affricates
	- technically affricates are a stop and a fricative together
	- $[ʧ]$ = t-shuh, becomes "chhh"
	- $[ʤ]$ = d-zhuh, becomes "j" as in "dodge"
Flaps
	- constrict air very briefly
	- $[ɾ]$ = as in "edited"
Nasal
	- air comes out of nose
	- humming, "mmmmm"
	- $[ŋ]$ = "ngh," as in "sing" = nasally
	- "running" = $[ŋ]$, "runnin'" = $[n]$
Liquid
	- aka approximant
	- sounds with not much constriction
	- air comes down the center of the tongue
	- $[ɹ]$ as in "run"
	- also, $[r]$ is not used in English, used for rolling r's
Lateral liquid
	- aka approximant
	- not much constriction
	- air comes down the sides of the tongue
	- $[l]$ = "luh"
	- distinguishing between lateral and non lateral is unique to English
Glide
	- aka approximant
	- not much constriction
	- like a liquid, but tongue is moving/"gliding"
	- $[w]$ = "wuh" = voiced labio-velar glide = shown under bilabial and velar
	- $[j]$ = "yuh", ariana grande's favorite



### Vowels
Starting with American consonants

Parameters for articulation
1. Height of the tongue
2. Backness of the tongue
3. Rounding (lips)
4. Muscle tension (tense/lax)

Monopthongs:
![[Vowel Chart for American English.png]]
See [[International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)#Vowels American English]] for descriptions of each monophthong and its pronunciation

Diphthongs: two monopthongs mushed together
$[oɪ]$ or $[ɔɪ]$ = "oi," "boy"
$[aɪ]$ = "aye," "I," "buy"
$[aʊ]$ = "ow," "bow"

Inherent diphthongs: difference in accents, certain sounds are diphthongized
$[eɪ]$ = "bait" "ay-ee"
$[oʊ]$ = "boat" "oh-uu"
