# Crime and Punishment

## In class notes (2/28)
### Dostoevsky
Fedor Dostoevsky 1821-81
Lived in St. Petersburg
Became part of a radicalizing group, read literature
Arrested and sentenced to execution by firing squad for free thinking
At the last moment, tzar commutes the sentence to 10 years of jail
Comes back to St. Petersburg a changed man, more cynical, progressive ideas watered down, becomes more religious
Reflected in prison, finding a path to salvation
Comes up with a hierarchy of sin
The worst sinners are not murderers, they can find redemption
If you do not believe in god, you only believe in yourself
Atheists and child molesters are on par as the worst sinners
C&P is about one man dealing with murder and how it isn't clear cut
Dostoevsky was always in debt, money is important in his novels

Dostoevsky's crime novels
- Crime and Punishment 1866 - Ideological murder, obsession with an idea
- The Idiot 1868 - Murder of passion, jealousy
- Demons 1872 - Political murder, emerging Russian terrorism
- The Brothers Karamazov 1880 - Patricide

Dostoevsky's "realism" is "fantastic" realism
- He pushed images and phenomena of everyday reality to the limits of the symbolic
- Some consider Dostoevsky a realist but it is not all pure realism
- Very melodramatic, very extreme situations of good and evil, lots of monologuing
- Lots of coincidences, dream sequences
- Symbolic realism / fantastic realism

Called the inventor of the "polyphonic" novel
- Multiple "idea-voices" co-exist and compete with each other on their own terms without the author's judgment
- Rashkolnikov is the battleground which these ideas compete in

Symbolic names and titles
- Prestuplenie i nakazanie (crime and punishment)
	- Prestuplenie = stepping over/crossing over a line, transgression
- Rodion Ramonivich Raskolnikov
	- Raskol = schism, split, break away, cut off
	- He splits between emotions, he split away from society, the axe
- Sonya / short for Sophia
	- Sophia = "wisdom" in Greek
- Razumikhin
	- Razum = common sense, reasoning
- Luzhin
	- puddle, "Mr. Puddle"

### History of C&P
1866
Published in installments in the journal "The Russian Messenger"
Some "a priory" thoughts on Dostoevsky and C&P
- Religious & philosophical writer
- His novels are not neat, they sprawl
- Stories are taking place in daily Russian life

### Analysis
Narrator
- Is the narrator omniscient? 
	- Limited omniscience, not first person
- Does Dostoevsky base parts of the book on his own life?
- What does Raskolnikov look like? 
	- Dark hair, handsome, skinny, "beautiful dark eyes," but ragged, doesn't care about his appearance
Space
- Where is the novel set?
	- In St. Petersburg, hot summer, 1860s
- How is Raskolnikov's room described?
	- Small, stuffy, low ceiling, "more like a cupboard than a room"
	- Metaphor for himself, a foil
	- Room = Raskolnikov's mind
	- Stuck living in the attic = trapped in his mind
Privacy
- Open spaces
- Living spaces not private
- Eavesdropping
- People coming and going from Raskolnikov's room
Time
- Crisis time (time moves slowly) vs. dream time (time moves quickly/loss of time)
	- Time can be stretched out, paragraphs are used to describe just a few seconds
	- Time can move quickly, a few sentences decribe a loss of time or a full period of time
- Linear time vs. flashbacks
- Book itself is fairly linear, does not jump around in time too much, but still has flashbacks and dream sequences

Missed class on parts 3 and start of part 4

##### Notes from in class discussion on parts 4, 5
- dunya rejects luzhin
- when people confess to someone they have a certain power over them
- raskolnikov confession(s) to sonya
- raskolnikov is terse to sonya
- raskolnikov, the one confessing, has power
- when svidrigailov confesses to raskolnikov, svidrigailov controls the conversation
	- "birds of a feather"
- raskolnikov has a guilty conscience and svidrigailov is at peace with himself he is fine with his crimes
- porfiry
	- confessions/interviews
	- porfiry has power over raskolnikov
	- "he looks like a peasant woman" quoting prof
	- strange description for a policeman
	- an unconventional detective
	- brings razumikin along to the first interview
	- raskolnikov uses razumikin in order to seem innocent
	- porfiry also uses people and plays games
	- its like death note!
	- "On Crime" written by raskolnikov
	- finds out raskolnikov wrote it by coincidence he knows the editor
	- raskolnikov talks about "men vs louses" 
	- men with greater morals are allowed to transgress and break laws for the greater good
	- uses napoleon as an example
	- uses this writing to incriminate raskolnikov and get him talking
	- biblical reference: porfiry mentions lazarus
	- does raskolnikov win or lose this conversation?
		- raskolnikov recognizes the trap and knows he is under suspicion and is able to evade porfiry's games
- second interview
	- porfiry is smirking, winking, acting strange, unconventional
	- talks about evidence and methods he uses, methods that police use to investigate, revealing his traps
	- porfiry believes in no system and no methods, it depends on the person being investigated
	- why doesnt he arrest raskolnikov?
		- he says that some people, you arrest them, and you give them stability
		- since he doesnt have stable evidence, he doesnt want to have raskolnikov in a cell, he would be stable and sitting there in a cell
		- porfiry wants him to continue the torture of living his life with his burden
		- this idea of a burden being lifted could be symbolic of lazarus
	- raskolnikov almost faints, porfiry offers him water, and raskolnikov refuses
		- symbolic of baptism
	- the guy hiding behind the door, porfiry's trump card, will claim that raskolnikov is guilty
	- just before, the painter comes in and confesses, surprising both raskolnikov and porfiry
	- the guy behind the door apologizes to raskolnikov
		- the innocent apologizing to theguilty

lazarus
- mentioned by porfiry, mentioned by sonya
- parallels raskolnikov, rebirth, raskolnikov should confess to become reborn

kahoot break

part 5
marmeladov funeral after party is a mess, sonya accused of theft by luzhin, luzhin is proved guilty of framing her, ivanovna is evicted and dies after

money
- what role does money play in part 5?
	- Funeral dinner is organized with Raskolnikov's money (25 rubles)
		- done out of compassion
	- Luzhin wishes he gave Dunya some money
		- done maliciously as plan to win Dunya over
	- Luzhin gives money to Sonya (10 rubles) and slips more money in her pocket (100 rubles) and during the funeral dinner accuses Sonya of theft
		- done to implicate Sonya and blackmail Raskolnikov in exchange for Dunya
		- luzhin's roommate vouches for Sonya, Raskolnikov claims that Luzhin is framing Sonya in order to spite him
	- Svidrigailov gives money to Ivanovna's kids and her funeral and helps Sonya out of poverty
		- svidrigailov planned to give this money (10,000 rubles) to Dunya to look good to Raskolnikov, but gives them to Sonya now to spite Raskolnikov after finding he is guilty
		- he needs raskolnikov

the funeral
- a wake, russian tradition
- ivanovna is a proud woman
- poor people, strangers show up for free food, the spectacle of the landlady vs ivanovna
	- germans and poles mentioned specifically
- more "noble" people turn down the invite because of sonya
- ivanovna gets angry
- luzhin appears, is the person of highest stature at the wake
- luzhin accuses sonya and she is surprised but feels resigned, she can't defend herself
- raskolnikov is just watching
- lebezaitnikov comes to sonyas defense
	- name means "Mr. sycophant"
	- luzhins roommate
	- called a socialist/nihilist
		- believes environment controls men, influences their actions
		- believes in sonya as she is breaking the status quo through prostitution
	- dostoevsky does not like socialists
		- women should leave a traditional family and be with multiple partners
		- he tries to sleep with sonya, and when she refuses, he gets her kicked out of the apartment, which is why she lives in a different building
		- rejects philanthropy and compassion
	- lebezaitnikov is a hypocrite parroting socialist rhetoric
- the fact that lebezaitnikov speaks to Sonya's aid is a miracle - no one expects this from this character
	- he didn't know that he would become enraged and defend Sonya
- described as having bad eye sight, so him seeing luzhin slip the money can also be seen as a miracle
- once lebezaitnikov comes to sonya's defence, raskolnikov jumps in to defend as well

- everyone scatters
	- ivanovna is evicted, makes a scene, taken to sonya's room, dies
	- raskolnikov goes to sonya's room, asks sonya to weight luzhin's life and the lives of her stepmother and the children
	- it is a simple question but still so difficult
	- she replies she is not the judge and she doesnt know gods path for luzhin


### In class notes 3/21

Two conversations with Sonya
- Power of confession talked about last time
- Looks down on Sonya
- Choose between luzhin and the children
	- Impossible choice, existential
	- Sonya abstains from the question, God makes these decisions

How are the two conversations the same?
- In both R. is tyrannical abuses and torments Sonya

How are they different?
- R. is fully in control <-> reason fails; he cries
- "We both transgressed we are the same" <-> "We are different"

Sonya tells R. he needs to repent
- Sonya is stronger than R.
- She sees him as miserable
- Go to the crossroads and confess

- Can't confess because of his pride
- Why would he confess to the people in the streets they are just as guilty as he is
- Sonya says he doesn't need to confess for them, he needs to confess for himself

- Sonya offers to give Lizaveta's cross to R. but he rejects it
- When you exchange crosses in Russian Orthodox you become sisters and brothers in Christ


Part 6

All about Raskolnikov making a choice
"Everything seems to be predetermined in this story, with chance encounters and coincidence"
What are Raskolnikov's options?
- Porfiry comes to his home
- Svidrigailov comes to his home
"R. is split between these two characters and their options"
- Porfiry (similar to Sonya): 
	- knows R. did it
	- tells him to confess in two days or be arrested
	- tells him he is suffering and needs to accept fresh air
	- tells him he is sincere, in turmoil, he has a future but he has mistakes
	- confession means a lighter sentence
	- says that if he commits suicide, he should leave a note so that the other guy isn't persecuted
- Svidrigailov: 
	- "you can live like this, I do"
	- living beyond morality, beyond consciousness
	- "everything is allowed; life beyond morality or suicide"
	- R. will consider the option of suicide as not only a viable one but a preferable one, can still be a strong man
	- Svidrigailov kills himself in public
	- Svidrigailov tries to coax Dunya into killing him
	- He wants to take as many people with him to damnation


Dostoevsky on faith
- see slide in blackboard


Epilogue

What is the narrative function of an epilogue?
- closure

Is the epilogue told in the same narrative tone as the rest of the novel?
- told in one voice
- third person, clear narration
- knows what's right and wrong (unlike the rest of the novel)

Where?
- Siberia

Time in the novel vs. time in the epilogue
- The six parts of the novel takes place over a week or two
- The epilogue takes place over years
	- "9 months pass", alluding to birth, rebirth
	- Spiritual rebirth is happening in Spring, around Lent and Easter

"Novel switches gears"
