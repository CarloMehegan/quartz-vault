# Language Change I
### Synchronic and Diachronic Variation
##### synchronic
differences in dialects
ex. English speakers speak the same language but with many varieties

##### diachronic
variation over time from itself
ex. the way we speak English now in 2022 is different from how people spoke English in 1922, 1822, etc

all languages have diachronic and synchronic variation
they vary from themselves dialectically and historically

ex. some linguists refer to "Englishes" to refer to different historic variations

how do we look at language change?

### Sound Change
happening constantly in all languages
we'll see present-day sound change in a future lab - northern cities vowel shift
driven by various phological processes; looking at two specific ones

##### assimilation
see [[Morphology II#Assimilation]]:
![[Morphology II#Assimilation]]

##### lenition
sometimes called "weakening"
sounds becoming less prominent than they used to be

need some phonetics knowledge to know what sounds are "weaker" than others
ex. stops are considered stronger than fricatives
see: [[Consonant Chart for American English.png]] (linked at the bottom of this page)

stronger sounds become weaker
ex. Latin 'pater' becomes English 'father'
- stop becomes a fricative, gets "weaker"

ex. Latin 'ped' becomes English 'foot'
- voiced sounds ($[d]$) become voiceless ($[t]$)
- vowels? very complicated to trace
	- we have a whole class on that

##### example: Grimm's Law
Grimm was a folklorist
He had a brother they were besties

"chain shift"
- a type of sound change
- a bunch of sounds are changing at once, each change affecting the others

Proto-Indo-European (super old) language shifting into Western Germanic (more modern) language
- all voiceless stops -> became voiceless fricatives
- voiced stops -> voiceless stops
- voiced aspirated stops -> voiced stops (and some voiced fricatives)
- aspiration is no longer phonemic
- happened over generations
- happened a long time ago, BCE

Grimm studied this change and figured out what these changes were

Can we take an old version of a word and turn it into a modern word?
Try changing the consonants (won't look at vowels too complicated)
1. $[g^hrem]$ - 'angry'
2. $[kad^h]$ - 'covering'
3. $[b^heÉªd]$ - 'cut'

1. $[gr\_m]$ -> becomes 'grim'
2. $[h\_d]$ -> becomes 'hood'
3. $[b\_\_t]$ -> becomes 'bite'

we can see there are meaning changes as well as sound changes

### Family Relationships
tracing the history and evolution of a language
classifying languages by their parents and siblings and children

ex. niger-congo family
ex. sino-tibetan family
ex. iriquoisan family

##### example: Proto-Indo-European (PIE)
![[Pasted image 20220411132309.png]]
- spread across Europe, Middle East, Indian subcontinent
- languages we looked at in examples today were part of this family
- people started studying language during the 18th-19th century colonization, lots of European scholarship and new languages
- interested by how similar Latin and Sanskrit were, seemingly disparate languages
- started looking for common ancestor
- trying to get away from colonization-era assumptions

how did we figure out what proto-indo-european sounded like without hearing it or even having and writing? how do you use linguistics to reconstruct a 5000 year old language?

we can use family trees like this to figure out how languages are related

##### cognates
words from two languages in the same family
words with similar forms and similar meaning

ex. Italic family,
- Italian 'biblioteca'
- Spanish 'biblioteca'
- Catalan 'biblioteca'
- Romanian 'biblioteca'
- French 'bibliotheque'

an important building block used for figuring out how languages have changed

different from 'cognates' used in classes for learning language
ex. Indo-European family
- Italian 'libreria' means "bookstore"
- English 'library' means "library"
- in a language class these would not be cognates
- they *are* cognates for linguistic purposes

ex. not cognates
- Indonesian 'buku' means 'book'
- English 'book' means 'book'
- *not* cognates
- Indonesian borrows the word from English
- Indonesian and English are not in the same family
- not the same as a cognate
