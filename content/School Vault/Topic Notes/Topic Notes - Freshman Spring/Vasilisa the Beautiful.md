Reading for CS100 Feb 7

Vasilisa the Beautiful
- Only child of a merchant in a kingdom
- Mother passed away when she was 8
- "Vasilishuska"
- Mom gave her a magic doll

Doll
- "Give it food and ask its advice"
- "Do not show it to anyone"

Father remarried to a widow with two daughters
Stepmother and stepsisters were jealous of her beauty and gave her chores to do hoping she would grow tanned from sun and thin from toil

Doll helped Vasilisa
Doll did chores for her

Stepmother won't let Vasilisa get married before her other daughters

Baba Yaga
- Lives near stepmoms new house
- step mom tried to send Vasilisa to be eaten
- doll keeps Vasilisa away from Baba Yaga

Step sisters send V to go get a light from Baba Yaga when the candle goes out

Doll called her Vasilishuska like her mother had

"Having made the sign of the cross"


Completely white horseman - Daybreak came
Completely red horseman - Sun began to rise

Didn't get to Baba Yaga until the following evening, walked all night and all day

Completely black horseman - Night came

"Baba Yage drove out in a mortar, prodding it on with a pestle, and sweeping her traces with a broom"

To get the light she must live with Baba Yaga and work for her

A second mention of the horsemen as another day passes

"The morning is wiser than the evening"

Baba Yaga keeps summoning a set of three hands to press poppy seeds or grind wheat and I really don't know what to make of that

"He is my bright day"
"He is my red sun"
"He is my dark night - and all of them are my faithful servants."

"I do not like to have my dirty linen washed in public, and I eat the overcurious"

Baba Yaga sends V home with a burning skull on a stick

Stepmother and step sisters welcome her graciously, they couldn't take care of themselves without her

"and whatever light was brought by the neighbors went out the moment it was brought into the house"

"'Perhaps your fire will last,' said the stepmother."

The skull's eyes kept staring at the mother and daughters and burned them by morning they were all burned to ashes only V remained untouched
Uhhh ok

And then V finds shelter with an old lady in town and wants to have work to do so she spins some thread and it's so fine (because her doll helped her) that the old lady takes it to the tsar's palace and the tsar tries to sew shirts from the linen but fails because it's so fine so they take it back to V and she says she knew she would have to do this work and made a dozen shirts and the tsar fell in love with V and they got married and when V's father came back he lived in V's house and the old lady lived there too and V carried the doll in her pocket until the end of her life



Ok so what did all that mean
