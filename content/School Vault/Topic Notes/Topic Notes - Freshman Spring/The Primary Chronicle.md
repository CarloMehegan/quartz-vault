##### Notes from reading
0. Prologue
- Kievan Crypt Monastery
- Nikon
- Nestor


1. Prolegomenon
- "Tale of bygone years"
- Sons of Noah
	- Shem, Ham, and Japeth
	- Divided the earth
	- Shem claimed the Orient: India, Rhinocorura, Persia, Bactria, Syria, Media, Euphrates River, Babylon, Assyria, Mesopotamia, Arabia, Phoenicia, etc
	- Ham claimed the southern region: Egypt, Ethiopia, Ethiopian river, Libya, some regions of the Orient, Sardinia, Crete, Cyprus, Nile River, etc
	- Japheth claimed the northern and western sections: Albania, Armenia, Macedonia, the Slavs, Adriatic Sea, Britain, Sicily, Ithaca, Ionia, Tigris river, Hungary, etc
	- Japheth also claimed Russia, Chud, Prussia, Varangian Sea, Sweden, Norway, Rus, Italy, Rome, Greece, Germany, Venice, Genoa, the Angles, etc.
- Tower of Babel
	- One language before
	- Planned to build a tower as high as heaven itself
	- God didn't like the tower
	- Divided the people into 72 races and scattered them across the world
	- And destroyed the tower
- After the tower's destruction
	- The sons of Shem occupied the eastern regions
	- The sons of Ham occupied the south
	- The sons of Japheth occupied the west and north
	- "Among these 72 nations, the Slavic race is derived from the line of Japheth, since they are the Noricians, who are identical with the Slavs."
- The Slavs
	- Split off into other subgroups
	- "Thus the Slavic race was divided, and its language was known as Slavic."
- Skipping the last parts of this its more geographical explanation of nothing


2. The Apostle Andrew Comes to Russia
- 10th or 11th century Apostle Andrew visited the territories that would become Russia on his trip to the Greek colonies on the Black Sea
- This legend laid the foundation for the later theory of Russia as the guardian of the Orthodox Christian faith
- He predicts a great city being built or whatevs and later Kiev is built there
- Reached the Slavs
- Observed how they bathed
- "They warm themselves to extreme heat, then undress, and after anointing themselves with tallow, they take young reeds and lash their bodies. They actually lash themselves so violently that they barely escape alive. Then they drench themselves with cold water, and thus are revived. They think nothing of doing this every day, and actually inflict such voluntary torture upon themselves."


3. The Founding of the City of Kiev
- Founded by three brothers, Kii, Schek, and Khoriv
- One of the oldest historical legends of Russia
- Sister named Lybed
- The brothers lived on three separate hills
- Built a town and named it Kiev after their oldest brother
- Polianians were the original founders of Kiev
- Some think Kii was a ferryman but this text vehemently disagrees
- All three brothers and their sister lived their whole lives in Kiev


4. The Beginning of the Russian State and the Arrival of Rurik
- The Russians called the Vikings the Varangians
- Difficult to determine how important Varangian settlers were to the organization of the Russian state
- "The Chronicle records that Rurik, the leader of a group of Varangians, was invited to rule over Novgorod in 862, and legend has it that Rurik became the founder of both the Russian state and the dynasty that ruled Russia until 1598, when Fedor, the son of Ivan IV, died without an heir."
- Scholars can't decide if Rurik founded the state or if it was there long before him
- The Slavs drove out the tribes that demanded tribute of them and decided to govern themselves
- Infighting ensued
- The tribes (The Chuds, the Slavs, and the Krivichians) began to seek "a prince who may rule over us"
- Went to the Varangian Rus and found three brothers to rule them and the bros migrated all the Rus and settled in different places
	- Eldest brother Rurik in Novgorod
	- Second brother Sineus in Beloozero
	- Third brother Truvor in Izborsk
- The district of Novgorod became Russian (Rus) land
- Sineus and Truvor died after two years and Rurik assumed authority
- Boring stuff
- Rurik's boyars find Kiev long after the three brothers who built it passed on
- Eventually Rurik gained rule of Kiev
- Something something invading Constantinople idc next story


5. Prince Olec's Campaign Against Constantinople
- Rurik died in 879 leaving his affairs to Oleg, in view of the infancy of Rurik's son, Igor
- 882 Oleg moves capital from Novgorod to Kiev
- Oleg consolidated many Slavic tribes
- 907 Oleg attacks the Greeks
- They attached wheels to their ships and "when the wind was favorable they spread the sails and bore down upon the city from the open country"
	- That is sick
- Russians made peace with Greeks on their terms but they are boring ships and people and money and whatever
- They make peace and the Greeks kiss the cross and Oleg swore to his weapons and his God or whatever
- "The people called Oleg 'the Seer,' for they were but pagans, and therefore ignorant."


6. The Death of Oleg
- His magicians tell him that his horse will cause his death
- The horse dies years later and he thinks he's defeated death
- He goes to see the horse's remains and stomps on the skull triumphantly but gets bit by a snake in the skull and dies
- Lollllll


7. Igor's Death and Olga's Revenge
- Igor becomes ruler
- Not the best
- Died skirmishing at present-day Polish border
- His widow revenged him
- This story is close to a folklore's motifs
- Whatevs she gets revenge burns a village down kills everyone



21. The Martyrdom of Boris and Gleb
- Do I need to read this part


22. The Beginning of the Kievan Crypt Monastery and its Founder, St. Antonius
- Do I read this too
- Whatevs I'm tired I'm going back to the dorm
