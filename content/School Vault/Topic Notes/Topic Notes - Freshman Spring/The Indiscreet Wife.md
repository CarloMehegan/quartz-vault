[[Russian folklore]]

Reading for CS100 Feb 7


Man and wife work on the river

Wife finds a treasure and tells everyone about it

Man pranks wife by switching a hare and a pike in their traps

The took all their money and drove home
Not sure I'm following what this treasure is but whatever

On the way home they see a bear tearing a cow apart
"Be quiet, wife! That is the devil thrashing our barin."

Barin = master in Russian according to google translate

Wife blabs about treasure and the barin asks about it
Wife talks about pike and hare and the barin being thrashed by the devil and the actual barin is confused and has her lashed
