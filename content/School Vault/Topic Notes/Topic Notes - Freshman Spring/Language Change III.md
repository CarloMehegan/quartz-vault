# Language Change III
### Social Causes of Change
language contact
- conquering
- colonization

society changes
- religion, culture, ideology
- technology - broadening of communication

When does a language become a new language? What's the cutoff where we decide a language has become a different language?
- geographic movement
- territory change due to conquer

ex. English 490 AD
- when England was conquered
- marked as the point where English came into use


### Language Contact: Old English (5th-11th c.)
Angles and Jutes and Saxons live in England (after conquering it)
English in England; different kinds
- East Angles
- South Saxons
- West Saxons

"When we talk about English we talk about it like it's one thing"
- never a point in the history of English where it's all one language
- "Englishes"

example:
Fæder ure þu þe eart on heofonum
si þin nama gehalgod

- from the English Bible (good example because there's many translations)
- West Saxon version of English
What strikes you about this English?
- sounds like a different language
	- sounds like pieces of many different languages
- differences in pronunciation, grammar
	- different letters from Modern English, and different sounds we don't have
	- phonetic differences
	- different word order
	- different affixes
		- "heofonum" = heaven
		- "num" is an affix
		- synthetic


### Language Contact: Middle English (12th - 15th c.)
another group of people, the Normans, conquer the Angles and Jutes and Saxons 
William the Conqueror
1066
Normans = "northern men" spoke Norman French

instead of driving existing peoples away, the Normans rule over them
both
two languages coexisting
plus the religious language, Latin

English language wins out, but is influenced by French
influenced in ways that can show us what the society was like

ex. English words influenced by French
- cow, ox, pig, chicken, geese
	- peasants spoke English, raised the animals
- beef, pork, bacon, poultry
	- the rich ate meat
- we can tell who the ruling class was from the language
- "like a fossil of the social language at the time"
- "English is a synonym-rich language"

see: [[Language Change I#example Proto-Indo-European PIE]]
![[Pasted image 20220411132309.png]]
in this chart we see French as a dotted line to Middle English

the majority of the vocabulary from the English language is descended from Norman French
as the languages come together, the structure changes
- was synthetic, then analytic
- lost affixes

same Bible example:
Oure fadir that art in hevenes
halewid be thi name
- each letter in the word is pronounced more
- more long drawn out sounds
	- to is pronounced "toe"
- can see French words
	- 'tentacion' (i didnt see spelling) is 'temptation'
- words are getting closer to modern
	- "that" is used different but we recognize the word
- "name" e isnt silent "na ma"


### Social Change and Technology: Early Modern English (15th - 17th c.)
William Caxton brought the printing press to England
books became widespread
three monks took one year to copy a book
one person takes three days to copy a book

Religious change
Roman Catholic Church -> Protestant Churches
Latin -> English

English used to be a peasant language
in Middle English, Latin was religion, French was ruling class, English was peasant
now, English has power as religious language

books used one standard dialect of English instead of trying to use different dialects
Caxton picks London variety, because he speaks it

London English now has power as an academic language
dwarfs other dialects
brings more power to English

same Bible example:
Our father which art in heaven
hallowed be thy name
- closer to modern
- "that" has become "which", still not really the relative pronoun we would use today
- "thy" "thee" "thou" is singular informal and "you" is plural formal
- "hallow" we don't hear this word in modern english except in religious context usually
	- "hallow" becomes "holy" later


###  Influence of Ideology: Modern English (18th - 21st c.)
London English was used for printing for no particular reason
now, London English becomes prestigious
- the Bible is printed in London English
- Shakespeare is printed in London English
- the ones who read are the nobility, rich people

London English becomes English
- becomes associated with, education, politics, reading, wealth, power
- becomes seen as proper english

ideology
- people begin believing linguistics is vital to success
- people think English should be more like Latin, idolized Rome, etc

- Robert Lowth
	- wrote about 'proper' English
	- "don't end sentences with prepositions" 
		- because you couldn't do that in Latin
	- "don't split infinitives"
- prescriptive ideologies
	- ideologies still seen in grammar today
	- [[Morphology IV#hypercorrection]]
	- American English today is taught similarly
		- there is a correct way to speak
		- the correct way is usually based on powerful regions
			- new england vs deep south

same bible example:
Our father who is in heaven
May your name be holy
- not what I say in church, the early modern version is used today
- much more similar to today's English
- loses some meaning as a translation
	- "hallowed" vs "holy"
	- doesnt hit the same tbh!


### Conquering and Colonizing: Contact Languages
conquering leads to language replacement or new language merging/influence
contact languages: whole new languages that come from colonization

##### pidgin
not a full language
people meeting with different languages from different groups
need to communicate
ex. trade contact
cant express complex ideas, for example, but can express certain ideas based on necessity
ex. conquered islands around the Caribbean

##### creole
a full language
"one generation speaks a pidgin, and the next generation creates a creole"
caused by a specific historical processes
can be traced back to pidgin, can be traced back to original languages
ex. Haitian creole
ex. Sierra Leone
ex. some creoles: Krio, Patwah, Tok Pisin

it's been argued that modern English is a contact language from Norman French conquer
English looks a lot like a contact language
- reliance on word order
- history of conquer
- vocabulary/lexicon from conquering people
not classified as a creole because there was not a pidgin stage

##### example
Example text from Tok Pisin (English-influenced contact language):
"this is why I use the Bible example it's the only one I can find in both Tok Pisin and Old English"
Papa bilong mipela yu stap long heven
nem bilong yu i mas i stap holi
- borrowed words
- can see "heven" = "heaven", "holi" = "holy"
- "bilong" comes from "belong", but is part of the grammar as a possessive
	- "nem bilong yu" = "your name"
- different word order
	- word order taken from Pacific Island languages


### World Englishes
where is English spoken as a first language?
- England
- US
- Hong Kong
- Singapore
- Philippines
- South Africa
- Jamaica
- Belize
- Canada
- Australia
- New Zealand

ex. video - Frozen in Singapore Singlish

ex. Taglish
