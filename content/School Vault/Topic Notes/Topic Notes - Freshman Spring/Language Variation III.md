# Language Variation III
### Ways of Speaking
we've talked about dialect vs. language [[Language Variation I#linguistic definition of dialect and language]] but there's more more kinds of variation

##### Dialect
a variety with its own phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon
mutually intelligible
a version of a language, just as legitimate as a language

##### Idiolect
individual variety/way of speaking/signing
an individual's dialect, because all language users have differences
ex. prof's sister worked in a different part of the country, developed [[Mapping American English Dialects|Northern Cities Shift]]
ex. when my aunt worked in the UK she got like a weird Filipino British accent

##### Jargon
technical lexical items (words) having to do with occupations/technology
ex. all these terms are linguistics jargon
ex. Italian words used in English as music jargon
ex. legalese
not just the occupation you work in, also from interests, hobbies, ordering Starbucks
doesn't vary in phonology (pronunciation doesn't matter just need the words)
morphology syntax etc. not taken into account either

##### Slang
heavily studied
predominantly lexical
in-group language
generational
first studied in 1800s, associated with criminals!
"cant" was the original term, "slang" was slang for cant
people think it comes from "thieves language" -> slang
associated with younger people today
cut-off of ~30 in the US where you see slang cut off, used less, new slang not being picked up, using slang only from their younger days, slang used incorrectly, unclear when slang goes in and out
slang that breaks syntactic rules ex. "because reasons"
slang that doesn't seem like slang ex. "I'm so tired" "same"
slang that stands the test of time ex. "cool" used since 1920s
slang that leaves use and then comes back ex. "vibes" today? from "good vibrations," etc. from the 60s
did swag come back I think so
Shakespeare used swagger as slang
slang that changes pronunciation ex. "yas"
