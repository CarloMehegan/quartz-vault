# Morphology II
### Allomorphs
More than one way to articulate the same morpheme

##### example: English past tense
$[hʌnt-əd] [laɪk-t] [muv-d]$
$[lænd-əd] [læf-t] [smaɪl-d]$ 

hunted liked moved
landed laughed smiled

all allomorphs of the same underlying morpheme
said differently, but all mean the same thing: past-tense

look at environments
for $[-d]$: l and v before -> voiced
for $[-t]$: k and f before -> voiceless
for $[-əd]$: t and d before -> alveolar stops
- using $[-əd]$ when after t and d, because those are the sounds for the other two allomorphs

What is the underlying morpheme?
$[-əd]$? seems to have its own conditioning environment, not the "elsewhere" case
$[-t]$? if t is the underlying form, then why do we use $[-əd]$ and not $[-ət]$?
$[-d]$? seems to be the norm for spelling, makes sense if $[-əd]$ is an evolution of $[-d]$
underlying morpheme is $[-d]$

Rule:
$/-d/$ -> 
actually no don't have to write a rule for allomorphs

##### example: English plurals
$[dɔg-z] [kæt-s] [hɔɹs-ɪz]$
not gonna write out the other two lines

dogs cats horses
cows giraffes fishes
gazelles goats

dogs cows gazelles -> ends with $[-z]$
cats giraffes goats -> ends with $[-s]$
horses fishes -> ends with $[-ɪz]$

$[-z]$ -> follows a voiced sound
$[-s]$ -> follows a voiceless obstruent
$[-ɪz]$ -> follows a sibilant

the $[-z]$ is actually the underlying morph here, not $[-s]$
shows that spelling can't always show which sound is the underlying morph

##### allophone vs. allomorph
allophones are sounds!
allomorphs have meaning!


### Assimilation
Sounds are becoming more like each other

Ex. vowels near each other merging in some languages

$[-s]$ allomorph for English plural that would appear after voiceless sounds
becomes $[-z]$, this is assimilation

Most extreme form is when a sound becomes another sound
This can happen over time

Ex. Latin "octo" becoming Italian "otto" $[kt]$ -> $[tt]$ The $[k]$ has assimilated
Ex. English "cupboard" $[pb]$ -> $[b]$ The $[p]$ has assimilated

When trying to find why there are different allomorphs, assimilation may be the culprit
There are also other reasons besides assimilation, like difficulty in pronunciation, epenthesis


### Exercise: Isthmus Zapotec
Done on paper
Takeaways:
- In Isthmus Zapotec, if a voiced consonant follows the possession-indicating prefix $[s-]$, then the consonant becomes voiceless
- This is an example of assimilation

### Intangibles (to be rewritten)
- the process of turning $[-d]$ into $[-əd]$ in past tense is panthesis? I forgot what the word was but the procss of adding a vowel in between those $[d]$ sounds 
	- epenthesis = inserting an extra vowel
