notes march 30

watch scenes with the sound off
sound is very effective at influencing perception of a shot

continuity system of editing
hollywood uses this
- "invisible" editing, designed to propel story
- elements
	- 180-degree rule
	- shot reverse shot
	- point of view shot
	- match on action
	- sound overlap cuts

notes april 4

what can you analyze in a film / elements of the film form
- sound
- cinematography
- editing / transitions
- mise en scene
- perspective / point of view
- motifs
- genre

editing
usually cuts, invisible editing is the goal

##### montage
is a type of editing
a self standing sequence
tells its own story
ex. godfather baptism scene, strike

ex. godfather clip
what two sequences are intercut here?
- baptism scene, guy renewing his baptismal vows
- a bunch of hits getting carried out, ordered by the guy
references to Sergei Eisenstein

Sergei Eisentstein
- very early soviet film director
- one of the "fathers" of film

ex. strike clip
by Eisenstein
what two sequences are intercut here?
- slaughtering a cow
- slaughtering striking workers running away

Eisenstein calls it a "ideological montage"
"juxtaposition of images"
