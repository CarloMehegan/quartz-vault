# Antiderivatives
"Finding the antiderivative implicitly accounts for all of the information needed to add up the values between two bounds"
-3blue1brown, Essence of calculus chapter 8, 16:05

### Synopsis
It's the opposite of a derivative. Used to find integrals. The relationship between antiderivatives and integrals is what [[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus|FTC part 2]] is about.

The [[Constant C]] represents a constant at the end of an antiderivative.

### Detailed Definition
An antiderivative is the opposite of taking a derivative. To find it, you do the opposite of what you would do to find a derivative. It's like going up a level instead of going down. The derivative of the antiderivative gives you back the original function.

A function has infinite antiderivatives, because any constant in an antiderivative would be cancelled out when you take the derivative. The [[Constant C|constant C]] is used in antiderivatives to represent this value.
