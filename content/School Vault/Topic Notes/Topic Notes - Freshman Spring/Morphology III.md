# Morphology III
### Typology
Grouping by structure
Language patterns
Analyzing how humans do things in language
Focusing specifically on morphological typology ([[Syntactic Typology]] in a future lab)

Analytic vs. synthetic
Analytic add words to add meaning
Synthetic add morphs to words to add meaning
##### analytic/isolating language
Rely on word order
Lots of free morphs
Not much morphology compared to other languages
"dog bite man" vs. "man bite dog"
ex Mandarin Chinese uses many free morphs
- direct translation of words: "I plural play piano"
- direct translation of words: "I plural play piano past"
- Adding words in order to add context/meaning

"Isolating language" as in morphs are isolated

##### synthetic languages
Add morphs in order to add meaning
3 types
- Fusional (used to be called inflecting)
- Agglutinating
	- Polysynthetic (similar to agglutinating but can be categorized on its own)

##### fusional/inflecting
ex. Classical Latin
- "am-avi"
- am = love
- avi = first person singular perfect active indicative
- "I have loved"
- Every morph has multiple meanings
- Need to use different morph entirely to change one of these meanings

##### agglutinating language
ex. Magyar (Hungarian)
- $[ha:z-unk-bcn]$ (rough transcription no fancy symbols)
- "house-our-in"
- "in our house"
- $[ha:z-od-bcn]$
- "house-your-in"
- "in your house"
- (Each transcription shows one word)
- Changing a morph in a word to change a meaning, each morph has a meaning
- Different from fusional because one morph does not not have multiple meanings, if you need multiple meanings, you use multiple morphs

##### polysynthetic
ex. Inuit
- "tuntussuqatarniksaitengqiggtuq"
- "he has not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer"
- To change one of these gloss words, you replace one morph in this big word
- Similar to agglutinating but more of an extreme form of it
- Difficult to find the root of the word

### Intangibles (to be rewritten)
- What category does English fit into?
	- "eaten" modifying a word -> synthetic agglutinating
	- "has not" adding a word -> analytic
	- Can it be both? Or is it just one?
	- "hasn't" is a conjunction like this synthetic?
- Tagalog is fusional!
- Structure is not dependant on history or areas of the world, etc
	- Different structures show up everywhere, and languages with the same structure are not specifically "related" to each other
- Klingon is agglutinating
	- It may be easier to make languages that are agglutinating because it takes less memorization (and maybe because they are similar to English and these fantasy languages are made by English speakers)
- Modern Hebrew deliberately changed to analytic (religious Hebrew was fusional) because it is easier to learn analytic as a second language
- **Modern English is analytic!** (old English was fusional)
	- There is a bit of morphology, like plurals or past tense
	- "Basically, English has moved in an analytic direction"
	- Still clings to some synthetic-style morphology from old English
	- If you're looking for synthetic examples, modern English is not what to look at because the synthetic uses are very basic, like plurals
- Fusional languages are very difficult for second-language speakers to learn, as they are not as intuitive
	- This is not a problem for people whose first language is the fusional language
- Learning languages of the same morphology type are easier
