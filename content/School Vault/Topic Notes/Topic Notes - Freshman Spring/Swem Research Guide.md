Talk for [[LING220 Variation Final Project]] on how to find sources in Swem

### Notes
##### Sources on Irish English
Scholarly Article: ‘She's a fucking ticket’: the pragmatics of in Irish English – an age and gender perspective.

Book chapter: Jeffrey L. Kallen, *Varieties of English*, Chapter 13: English in Ireland
https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/cwm/reader.action?docID=5116129&ppg=254

which one is more useful?
scholarly article
- covers irish variation of english
- looking at one specific word and its use
- charts and graphs
- narrow and specific

book
- covers irish variation of english
- more broad, covers more areas needed for the assignment
- covers history, social change, syntax, etc
- denser, longer

Scholarly articles are shorter and focus on specific, narrow topics, building on other knowledge
The article could be used for one of the categories the assignment asks for, but the book provides a more general source to keep the research together, concise

##### How to find books in Swem
Talk to the circulation desk
Lookup books on the Swem website
- Website search defaults to "all", switch to the books & media tab
- "Available at Swem (PB1291 .D5 1927)"
	- Used to narrow down where book is
	- Ask front desk if you need help finding books

Books are shelved by subject, so look at the books in the same section to find more sources
Ebooks have a search button
Most scholarly books have an index

databases also available
dont recommend jstor for linguistics, focuses on humanities and stuff
go to library databases -> linguistics category

looking specifically at Primo database which is the default when you search on the swem website
- left side bar lets you filter
	- filter to just articles/books/etc
	- filter to just within last 25 years
	- filter by subject ex. social sciences -> linguistics
- can combine search terms in search criteria bar
	- can use AND/OR
	- ex. irish english AND (attitude OR stereotypes)
	- quotation marks around a group of words will look for those words exactly
	- quotation marks around individual words doesnt bring up results for other morphs of that word

accessing articles
- some have pdf
- some have "online access" that brings you to another database
- if you find something you can't get access to and need, try WM's interlibrary loan service to get access to it through another library

getting help
online help under get help & support -> help & consulting -> live chat box
