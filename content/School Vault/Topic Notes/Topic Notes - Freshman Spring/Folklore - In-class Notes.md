In-class notes on [[Russian folklore]] and [[The Morphology of the Folktale by Vladimir Propp]]

###### What is folklore?
- Traditional, usually mythical stories
- Authors are unknown, tales told orally, difficult to date
	- Different from literature, where author is known, origin is known, etc.
- These tales were collected at some point and published
	- Famous tales, like Cinderella
		- Still different versions of these tales

- 19th century interest in folklore (Russian)
- Alexander Afanasyev (1826-1871)
	- Published *Russian Folk Tales* (1855-1864)

- [[The Morphology of the Folktale by Vladimir Propp]]
	- Vladimir Propp (1895-1970)
	- Professor of linguistics and folklore at St. Petersburg University
	- Russian Formalism
		- Scientific study of literature, akin to the natural sciences
	- Morphology of the Folktale (1928)
		- Morphology - term comes from biology/anatomy
		- One of the first to try studying the parts of texts in a scientific way
		- Aarne and Thompson's motif index
			- A&T created a classification of motifs
			- Aarne's basic typology - list of events that can happen in a story
			- According to Propp, Aarne's method is too specific (seen in list of 4 different tales at the beginning of Propp excerpt)
				- Propp will simplify these motifs into actions, or "functions"
		- Created a list of functions (seen in appendix at the end of the excerpt)
			- Found that these functions don't have to all occur, but they will always occur in the same order, like an alphabetical order (and each function is associated with an alphabetical symbol, to show that order)
			- Found a concrete pattern in these stories by using a scientific approach
			- Even across cultures, tales will follow these orders of function
		- Actors change, but their actions/functions are constant
		- Functions are limited, actors are infinite
		- Multiple-move tales
			- One move
				- A___W*
			- Two moves (serial)
				I. A___W*
				II.        A___W*
			- Two moves (embedded)
				I. A___G........K___W*
				II.        a.......K
			- A = villainy
			- W = wedding, ending
			- a = lack, insufficiency
			- G = moving to a designated place
			- K = liquidation of misfortune
		- **We don't need to memorize the functions but we will do some sequencing in future assignments**
