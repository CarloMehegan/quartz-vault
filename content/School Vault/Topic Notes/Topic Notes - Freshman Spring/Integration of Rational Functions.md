# 7.4 Integration of Rational Functions
notes written on paper

### Synopsis
This section is about integrating rational functions aka fractions with polynomials on the top and bottom. The method is called Partial Fraction Decomposition or just Partial Fractions.

numerator = $p(x)$
denominator = $q(x)$

If the degree of the numerator is higher than the denominator, then it is an "improper" rational function. For improper rational functions, you need to use long division in order to simplify the function into a quotient and a proper rational function left over.

When we decompose a rational function, we split $q(x)$ up into "irreducible" polynomials. These are polynomials that can't be split up farther, and they will be either degree 1 or degree 2 polynomials.

Method 1. The rational function can be split up into degree 1 polynomials
ex. $\int \frac {dx} {x^2-4}$













### Detailed Definition
*Theorem 1:*
$$
\int_{-a}^{a}f(x)dx = 2\int_{ 0 }^{a}f(x)dx
$$
