# Syntax II
### Trees
##### nodes 
- the tree diagram is made up of nodes
- nodes show where phrases are
- everything under any specific node makes up its own constituent
- these show how constituents can make up other constituents

##### constituents
- a group of related words in a sentence
- everything that falls under a node in a tree
- if done properly, everything under the same node makes up a constituent

##### parent/child relationships
- the determinant, adjective, and noun making up a noun phrase are "sisters" because they share the same "mother," the noun phrase node
- can find patterns between sisters/mothers/nieces/cousins/etc
- kinship terms use feminine markers because reasons

##### grammatical roles
Subject/Object?
- Subject is who "does" something in a sentence
- "Carlo kicked the trash can"
- But a passive voice reverses this, so how do we determine what the subject is
- "The trash can was kicked by Carlo"

Subject/Object Definitions
- Define the subject as the NP that is the daughter of the S
- The direct object is the NP that is the daughter of the VP
- Object of preposition is the NP that is the daughter of the PP


### Rules so far
NP -> (Det) (Adj) N (PP)
PP -> P NP
VP -> V (NP) (PP) (Adv)
S -> NP VP

Then (done on paper) we found that adverbs (Adv), a new category, are part of verb phrases, and can be put in different places

new rule:
VP -> (Adv) V (NP) (Adv) (PP) (Adv)

Syntax is about being able to find these rules
