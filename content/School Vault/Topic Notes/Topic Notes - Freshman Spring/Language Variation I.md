# Language Variation I
### Language Varieties
##### linguistic definition of dialect and language
dialect - a variety with its own phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon
language - a variety of with its own phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon
same things! basically

some linguists will say a dialect is mutually intelligible with other dialects of the same language
what about [[Language Change III#World Englishes|Singlish]]? what about Taglish in the Philippines? what about Scottish English?
some dialects are very different when do they become their own language?
"a language is a dialect with an army and navy" - Max Weinreich
dialect and language as terms get controversial

##### examples of varieties
AAE
Mexican vs Spain Spanish
Canadian French
Brazil vs Portugal Portuguese
Gullah
Cockney English
there's a billion

varieties are associated with different regions, ethnic groups, religious groups,

##### standards and prestige
standard variety
language speakers associate certain varieties as "standard"
some are "fancier"

###### standard? American English
who speaks standard American English?
is writing standard?
do certain regions speak standard?
do certain people speak standard?
- the King/Queen's language in UK
- journalist Walter Cronkite in US
is it the average between all American Englishes?
does anyone really speak the standard?
how do we decide how words are pronounced in the dictionary?

the standard variety is used by powerful people, is accepted, has prestige
how do you get prestige when speaking the language?
there are certain varieties with less prestige

###### overt prestige
prestigious ways to speak
prestige from using a standard variety
overt prestige is prestige in wider society, in academic use, in power, etc

###### covert prestige
certain dialects have prestige/respect in certain smaller regions
ex. African American English not being respected in wider academic use, in power, but respected in other communities

###### code-switching
or variety switching
linguistics used to call varieties, codes

switching dialects in certain situations, communicating with certain groups
if you speak a variety that is not considered standard, you might engage in code switching and use a different variety in certain contexts

switching between languages in bilingual communities
using slang vs being professional
switching to avoid discrimination

should you need to be able to code switch in order to participate in different parts of society?
no you shouldn't have to but you do in today's society

### Patterns
##### Standard American English
SAE
people say it's "more logical"
not always the case
ex. possessive pronouns singular/plural
- my/our
- your/your
- her,its,his/their
make into reflexive pronouns
- myself/ourselves
- yourself/yourselves
- herself,hisself,himself?,itsself/theirselves,themselves?
himself and themselves are used as standard instead of hisself and theirselves
not always more logical

people say it "sounds better" "feels better"
nothing linguistically or inherently good about certain standards

##### British English and Boston English
ex. Bostonian trying to talk to Siri video
- "trying Siri with my Boston accent, or so they tell me I have an accent"
- "can I park my car in Harvard Yard?" -> not understood
- "-ar" sound in park, car, harvard, yard, starbucks, becomes "-ah"
- "-r" sound is dropped
- non-rhotic rule, happend in certain positions (after a vowel sound here)
- Boston accent is stigmatized

ex. audio clip from someone living in Milton Keynes
Recieved Pronunciation British English, the standard in the UK
- vowel is elongated in "car" and "-r" is dropped "cahh"
- non-rhotic dialect
- other dialects like Boston dialect gets its non-rhotic rules from UK Standard English
- same non-rhotic feature in both dialects, but in one place it's nonstandard/stigmatized and in the other place it's standard
	- Boston accent associated with working class
	- UK pronunciation associated with upper class and education
	- standard comes from social positions

##### African American English
AAE, most studied variety of American English
also called AAVE, African American Vernacular English, as in common, social, but we don't use 'vernacular' in studying other dialects that would be considered 'vernacular'
looking at grammar rules and differences
verbs
- copula - 'to be'
	- zero copula, when verb is dropped in present tense
	- simple present
		- seen in many languages
		- "she be here but she not here"
			- habitual 'be', came to class today
			- but not in the classroom right now
		- happens where there could be a contraction
			- "she's here" "she here"
	- habitual 'be'
		- "he be running"
			- habitually runs
		- "she be here"
- tense, aspect, mood
- simple present zero copula "he running"
- simple present habitual be "he be running"
- perfect progressive "he been running"
- perfect continuitive "he steady running"
- subjunctive "he fixing to go run"

people care about standards
comes out of prestige, not necessarily logic/rules/aesthetics, it's about who is speaking it
all varieties have grammar, patterns, able to fully express
