# Constant C

#### Definition
[[Antiderivatives]] can have a constant on the end that is ambiguous.
If you are calculating an antiderivative, you should add the constant C to the end.
What does the C represent?

The constant represents any constant that could have been at the end of a function before differentiation. When you differentiate, all constants become 0, so it becomes ambiguous in an antiderivative what constant should be at the end, because it could be any constant. The C represents the constant.

#### Application
When you are solving for a [[Types of Integrals|Definite Integral]] using antiderivatives, the integral is equal to F(b) - F(a), a being the lower bound and b being the upper bound. When you subtract these two antiderivatives, the Cs cancel out, which is why the constant C is ignored in solving for definite integrals.

However, in an [[Types of Integrals|Indefinite Integral]], the constant C still shows up at the end, to represent all forms of the integral.
