Analysis of [[Russian folklore]]

Reading for CS100 Feb 7

I do not want to read this the other readings took forever and I'm bored I'm just gonna skim this


Morphology of folktales and how they've changed
How to define a folktale/fairytale

There are many recurring actions and recurring characters

It's important what the characters do, as well as who exactly is doing it
ex. Baba Yaga

One may say that the number of functions (actions characters take) is extremely small, whereas the number of personages is extremely large

Tales can be striking and also uniform with repetition

Propp tries to classify and define the functions

Function is understood as an act of a character, defined from the point of view of its significance for the course of the action

1. Function of characters serve as stable, constant elements in a tale, independent of how and by whom they are fulfilled.
2. The number of functions known to the fairy tale is limited.
3. The sequence of functions is always identical.
4. All fairy tales are of one type in regard to their structure.

This sounds crazy but it is true apparently according to this guy

Now he will prove it

Decided to use 100 tales for this study, from Afanesyev's collection (the ones we read before this reading)
Using tales No. 50 to No. 151

The excerpt ends here, followed by an appendix of abbreviations used for different functions, in order to how they would appear in a story, and according to Propp, there is no tale where these events would happen in a different order than going down this list


Thoughts
- This study is an example of [[Close vs. Distant Reading|Distant reading]], looking at the structure of the stories
