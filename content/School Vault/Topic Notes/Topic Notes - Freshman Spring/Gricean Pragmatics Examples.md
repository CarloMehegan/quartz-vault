Context: After spring break, two friends talk. Friend 1 knows Friend 2 planned to ask Sam out.

Friend 1: How did it go with Sam?  
Friend 2: So, how was your break?

What maxim is most important to understanding this interaction?
Answer: <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Relation</mark> , which¬†says to be relevant (asking about Friend 1's break is not relevant to how it went between Friend 2 and Sam)

Implicature: It went poorly with Sam
- calculable: Friend 2's response was not relevant because they don't want to answer the question because it went poorly
- cancellable: Friend 2 could say 'So, how was your break? ... Mine was awesome and I spent it with Sam'
- context-based: Friend 2's response means it went poorly with Sam only in the context of Friend 1's question

Context: In English class, a student named Casey, who has not raised their hand, is called on.

Professor: What's theme of the novel we read for today? Casey?
Casey: That's an interesting question that deserves much consideration given the myriad of complicated factors that arise when contemplating the depth and breadth of the novel and the intricacies and profundities of the plot with which the author showcases her erudition.

What maxim is most important to understanding this interaction?
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Manner</mark> , which says to be clear (the response seems deliberately unclear: lots of jargon and a run-on sentence)
OR <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Quantity</mark> , which says to be concise (the response does not say enough in answer to the question and says too much otherwise)

Implicature: Casey doesn't know the answer
- calculable: Casey doesn't give a clear answer/enough of an answer because they don't know the answer
- cancellable: Casey could next add the answer to what they've already said
- context-based: Casey's answer only means they don't know the theme of the novel in the context of being asked it by the professor

Context: Roommate 1 left a mess in the room they share with Roommate 2, but when they come back from class, the room is clean.

Roommate 1: Did you clean everything up?
Roommate 2: No, it was the cleaning fairy.

What maxim is most important to understanding this interaction?
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Quality</mark> , which says to be truthful (there is no such thing as a cleaning fairy, thus it is untrue that fairy cleaned the room)

Implicature: Yes, Roommate 2 cleaned the room and is unhappy about it
- calculable: since there is no cleaning fairy, it must have been Roommate 2, and since they deliberately answered untruthfully they must be indicating they are unhappy about it
- cancellable: Roommate 2 could then say 'it was your best friend, not me; I'm so happy you have such a neat freak in your life' cancelling the implicature -- or the cleaning fairy could then fly in and say 'yes, twas I'¬†üßö‚Äç‚ôÇ
- context-based: the unhappiness only arises because of the context in which it was Roommate 1 that left the mess
