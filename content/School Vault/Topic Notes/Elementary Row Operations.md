## Elementary Row Operations

In order to transform a matrix, there are **3 elementary row operations** that can be used.

1. Replacement
	Replace one row by the sum of itself and a multiple of another row, or, add to one row a multiple of another row.
	$R_i = R_i + \alpha * R_j, \alpha \neq 0$
2. Interchange
	Interchange two rows.
	$R_i \leftrightarrow R_j$
3. Scalar/Scaling
	Multiply all entries in a row by a nonzero constant.
	$\alpha * R_i, \alpha \neq 0$

These row operations preserve the solution set for the matrix. Two matrices are called **row equivalent** if a sequence of elementary row operations can transform one into the other. These operations are also reversible.
