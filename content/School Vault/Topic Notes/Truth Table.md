## Truth Tables
Truth tables represent how [[Logical Operator|Logical Operators]] modify propositions

Below are all the tables we have encountered in class

##### not truth table

##### and, or truth table

##### xor truth table
this table also shows how XOR can be represented with and, or, & not operators

##### implication truth table
this table also shows how implication can be represented with and, or, & not operators

##### equivalence truth table
this table also shows how equivalence is the conjunction of implication
if p and q are the same, then true

Proving equivalences through truth tables can become very time consuming, so we define algebraic, [[Logical Law|Logical Laws]] that can be used to simplify compound propositions and prove equivalence.
