### Tuesday, Feb 15

Good morning up so early it's 9:50 right now got up at like 8:50 and actually that's bad because I MISSED LAB! But whatevs I slept so so so so good I don't really care I'll just turn in the lab today, go to the caf, and do the next lab

When I got out of bed I did programming challenge 2 and 3 bc I'm awesome and they took like 5 min each and now I will do that writeup thing for the folklore website I don't really understand this assignment but whatever I'll just spend like 15 min on it

10:11 It's been about 15 minutes still haven't done it ok 15 more
10:43 ok submitted it actually took like 35 minutes gross but I'm so awesome for getting it done time to play fortnite

2:57 ok so I didn't play fortnite it had to update and I got bored waiting and got in bed and slept until 2 and I just got out of bed and I just found out no competitive programming today so now I really will play fortnite and just vibes

8:53 lol I'm at swem I found this group study room on the second floor near the stairs it's awesome anyways I am now here and it let me reserve it from 9 to 11 which doesn't really matter but it's about the mindset ok my goals for right now are
- Transcribe the action items from yesterday into notion / take care of them
- Work on ling notes get caught up so that they are pretty and it is good review
- I could work on math lab 3? probably won't I'll do that like Thursday or something
