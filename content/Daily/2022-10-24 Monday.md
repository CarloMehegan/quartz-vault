I FAILED! that project definitely what a disaster i have no sense of
allotting enough time for these projects
i always think the hardest part is over and i can just get the rest done rq
NO! it's all hard part!
do i just have to work on this class for like 2 hours every night? is that the only way to get these projects done?
and this sucks becasue project 4 relies on this so im gonna have to get it done ANYWAY
but now for no grade
ugh
im gonna play minecraft and be sad
at least theres no class tmr
i can wake up late
im gonna make popcorn and eat ice cream and play minecraft now fuck this
