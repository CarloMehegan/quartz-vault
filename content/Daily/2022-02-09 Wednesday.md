Oh my god my head hurts and I'm so tired CS100 is about to start other two classes were fine I just have a headache now and I have work to do tonight

ACM 6:30 thursday ISC 2280
Is ACM the one I wanted to do I can't remember loll

Hmmm maybe I'm already burned out of this journaling anyways it is midnight I took the most bestest nap I turned in two assignments feeling cool and no class tomorrow feeling so extremely cool not sure what I will do now I should work on notes tomorrow esp my LING flashcards anyways also the LING practice I should aim for half an hour total on those at least maybe 40 minutes idk 

I should definitely try to do daily obsidian notes that will be better than this format

Ok I just moved it all over
Another problem is that some of these notes have lists and checklists and stuff that I want to go back to how can I remember to look at those? Should I put those in Notion? Also bruh I'm typing in the old daily file again I will copy paste this over
