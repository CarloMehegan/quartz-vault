Currently in the library in a cute study room there's a TV in here I tried to use it it kinda sucks I should bring a hdmi next time anyways

I've spent 2 hours trying to figure out how I can export obsidian files so I can share my phonetics notes because I have to do that tmr and first I tried a Github pages and the links didn't work so I spent a long time trying to make a python script that would take all the files and replace the bracket links with proper markdown links and it didn't work I guess it was cool I learned maybe but still even with that the math jax didn't work so I gave up and spent a while trying to make continuously scrolling pdfs and that didn't work at all I downloaded Adobe Acrobat what a terrible virus then I uninstalled it anyways I guess I'll just share pdfs
