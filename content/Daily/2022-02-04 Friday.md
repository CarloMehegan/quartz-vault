### Friday, Feb 4
It is 6:20 pm it was a good day I feel anxious though and I'm not sure why

I got up at 10 and didn't do much until 11:30 but I got to calc on time went to ling it was good but I talked to her at the end of class about being late and she was kinda rude about it but whatevs I think I'll try to sit next to door in calc on Monday and leave ASAP and just speed walk idk there's not much I can do

After ling I went to the caf had pizza also I'm already tired of caf food I should try marketplace anyways after that I had ling lab it was fine I still need to find wired earbuds maybe Food Lion has them I could go there again this weekend get more sparkling water also I need to do laundry this weekend I hope the washer is working I should try to wake up early to do that just so I have an excuse to make myself wake up early

Also I still need to do my notes and I really just need a good study space because I can't get work done in my room that's a new goal find a nice relaxing study spot
