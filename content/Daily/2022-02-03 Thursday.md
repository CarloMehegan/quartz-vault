### Thursday, Feb 3
I didn't write anything yesterday but let's see it was good and productive I made popcorn in the hot pot it was awesome

Today I stayed in bed allllll day and I didn't get up until 7pm. Then I played skyblock and showered and played skyblock and made ramen and played bedwars and played skyblock and now I'm writing this it's 2:47 am

The only thing I wanted to do for today was work on my notes which is good because nothing is overdue or anything but bad because now I'm even more behind on them. Goal is to spend 20 minutes on them tomorrow. Also add drop deadline is tomorrow and I don't think I'm changing anything kind of sucks because no CS major classes but also it's fine because I like my schedule and the classes I'm in

12 credits last semester 13 this semester if you count the 7 from AP classes then I currently have 32 credits or at least I will at the end of this semester that's pretty good

Ok I should get in bed I'll try to be up at 10 tomorrow I wish I had a better way to wake up like the apps that can track your REM cycle oh well maybe I shouldn't set an alarm no that's a bad idea whatevs
