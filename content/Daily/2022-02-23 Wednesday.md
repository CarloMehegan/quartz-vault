### Wednesday, Feb 23

Hello obsidian my back has been hurting all day but at least the weather is nice I'm sitting outside near Blow hall in the circle where this big statue is it says the guy is James Blair first president of the college that's cool it is 5:01 pm my classes just ended I did programming challenge 4 at the end of cs when we were watching a clip from a Russian movie and I just did programming challenge 5 out here on this bench feeling cool love the breeze anyways what should I do now

I don't have anything to do tomorrow unless I wanna try going to a club meeting? Lol no I don't but that reminds me I should ok I just realized that everything I'm wearing is black and gray and everything I'm carrying is black and gray anyways I should sign up for the hack a thon sounds neat and low pressure it could be fun its march 23-25? or something

[[Cypher 7]]
I just need to find ppl to do this with me (or meet ppl there? lol no)

Today I took notes on paper wait didn't I write that already did I write that on my phone obsidian?? What a terrible problem I have I should like email obsidian and ask if they have a student discount for obsidian sync I would love to have that

Anyways in calc today I took notes on paper and not on obsidian in math and now I need to transcribe the main ideas? I really don't know how to do this in a way that like makes sense and can be done easily after every class. Maybe I need to give up on having math notes in obsidian or find some other way to form them. I also want to add a blurb in [[ðŸŽ¯MATH112 Hub]] for every like unit and topic that explains the topic with the context of everything else we learn so that I can connect these ideas which is also what obsidian is all about

Like today we started 7.4 and its like integrating rational functions and so if I can contextualize that with reference to like the division rule for derivatives and how it's kind of like doing that backwards (if it even is I dont know but this is what I should fin out), then I can compartmentalize this stuff in my mind I guess and make it easier to know when I see an integral what I should be doing to solve it

Anyways also I have these action points but then I lose them because I don't have them in a neat reference list like my Notion homepage do I just need to be referencing these in Notion? Can I make a nice table like I have in Notion in Obsidian and just use Obsidian? No idea and I wouldn't want to use just Obsidian because I have lots of stuff in Notion but I also don't wanna retype everything you know I'll retype my action items in Notion right now

Transcribe 7.4 notes that's a cute little thing what if I did that tomorrow when I woke up? I've been thinking about Tim Rogers work routine that he described in the Cyberpunk review part 2 - graphics and even though that routine almost killed him! I think I could glean some habits from that

I like his idea of a virtual commute (I mean I have a real commute but on days like Thursday with no class I can implement this) where he will check his notifications and read a chapter of a book or something for an hour or so after he wakes up that sounds nice

I was thinking this morning I could be so productive I could start working right now instead of showering and walking to class and having school stomach well maybe I can do that tomorrow do a little bit of work in the morning just transcribing those notes it should take like 15 minutes and it's actually the opposite of the virtual commute thing so explaining that did not matter but still if I can do a little task when I wake up I can feel productive even when I play skyblock for 5 hours after that

Anyways my tasks for the rest of the day
- Ask Emma if she wants to do the hack a thon?
- I should play the game jam games lol I keep forgetting
- Read crime and punishment I have to start! At least 1 page today or however kindle organizes it idk 100 sections
- Really nothing I have to do right now I'm tired and sore I can afford to put this stuff off for a day or two

Ok maybe I'll just sit on this bench for a while and then go back to the dorm and play creeper world 3 or something I can't believe it's 5pm I was like classes are done it's only like 1pm but no that was last semester ok bye
