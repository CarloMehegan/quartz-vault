### Sunday, Jan 30
I woke up at 10 which is good but then I played video games and now it's 6:57 pm which is bad but this is when I started working last night so maybe it'll be cool

Assignments I would like to have done tonight
- Linguistics autobiography
	- This is my main goal for tonight it should be simple I will make a flow chart I think I can start with Me in the middle and branching out from that have different areas of life like family, friends, internet, location, and why I chose to take LING 220 all be like sections and have nodes branching off of them and I can try to add pictures maybe
- Calc lab 0
	- Maybe I can work on this today because I'm sure I won't want to tomorrow I might be able to do it after ling during that break before cs but after I finish linguistics I could take a look at this again
- Calc notes on substitution rule
	- Yesterday I started working on my calc notes and I think structuring it like a wiki is gonna be useful so I have structure and I can have different pages for topics and sections and things like that. Tonight I could work on a page for substitution rule and I don't think it will take too long to do and it will be helpful to have that transcribed before class tomorrow

2:27 AM I have not done any work!!!!!!! A failure day idk what to do rn I just had no motivation to do anything well I think I just had the mindset that oh it's so easy I'll just set a little bit of time aside to get the assignment(s) done and do it later but that turned into me being up at 2 am having done nothing so not sure how to fix that but let's think on it

Not sure what to do now guess I'll do calc stuff tomorrow I really wanted to get the LING thing done tonight it's due tomorrow at like 5pm I think? I would just turn it in at midnight well I guess I will now but it'll be late now that sux Ok it's due at 1pm tomorrow lol I guess it'll be late this is a bad first impression along with the first impressions of being late to class but I've made a severe lack of judgment whatevs I should just get in bed and not lose sleep procrastinating plan is to still wake up at 10 tomorrow if I can finish the assignment before calc that will be a miracle also I didn't even take a shower today how embarrassing it'll be a morning shower then smh
