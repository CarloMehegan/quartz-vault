[[Fleeting Notes/2022-09-12 MATH211]]
[[Fleeting Notes/2022-09-12 CHIN309]]

i need to make topic notes and stuff and review [[2022-09-09 F22 Week 02]]
also im cracked at working and being productive i think im caught up for chin309 now i read the lao tzu reading for today i didnt read the first reading from columbia whatever but i think im clear to just not read that bc he went over that in the online lecture video but i guess we'll see right now class is starting
also ive been having the thought that im not working hard enough because what do i have to show from last year? not much ive just been going through the motions anyways class starting

also write out goals for the semester
- find connections between chin and japanese literature


i should use like #CHIN309timeline for all these dates so i can make a dataview list of everything
hey i can use tags to go back and "review" my fleeting notes even if im not going to make topic notes i can make tags!

i like chin309! people ask a lot of questions which is great bc i dont have to talk i can just type type its awesome also i have energy tonight it is 8 pm and im at sadler ab to get late night food i will try to work on the cs301 project the goal is to type 1 line of code and or write 1 function i just wanna review this again before class tomorrow

ok i made the 2d array and made it in the constructor and i made get and set methods that took foreverrrrrr i dont remember java syntax but im getting there
