### Today's Fleeting Notes


Did the first reading for Japn I didn't ge much from it I guess it talked about how travel writings have a bias and it's was focusing on 1800s writing about South American and African conquest

Also I had a Starbucks double shot energy mocha flavor from the Sadler shop I'm not sure if the caffeine does anything for me I was drowsy like right after I finished out but it's been about 40 minutes now and I'm pretty alert but still like fatigued
