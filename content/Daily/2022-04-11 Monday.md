guest speaker - on using [[Using Google Sites]] for our final project
notes on speaker not related to google sites:

Telling a story
1. find something interesting about a story
2. figure out the beginning, middle, end, organization
3. figure out mode of story telling (website here)

dramatic question
what questions are you asking?

think about the audience

websites are visual, reader is interacting, nonlinear, reader chooses where to go
how can we use this for our project?

how is the user navigating? how do you keep user retention?

think of 9 things to add to your story
"The Nine Circles" exercise from Jeremy Higham
