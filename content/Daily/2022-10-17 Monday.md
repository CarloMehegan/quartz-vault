[[Fleeting Notes/2022-10-17 CHIN309]]

obsidian 1.0 woooo
themes pls update
thats the only issue so far
tabs are cool ig

i am so demotivated and i cant get anything done
is it a seasonal thing
is it because i just checked grades and got a 13% in cs project 2 and a B on chin reflection and a B on the last math hw
is it bc i hate cs301 yes definitely this one
how do i start enjoying programming again
i keep getting snapchat memories from 4 years ago of me making lua games and i was actively working on that stuff outside of class
now i can barely work on these cs projects
theyre so convoluted and some parts of the instructions are very specific and hand holding but some are not and it makes it feel like im not doing it properly and i get lost
also i used my extension for project 3 so now i really have to get this going
whats my plan?
i guess first step in the instructions is the crc cards or whatever thats a good idea i should just go through every class and figure out what they do
i did that with the 2048 project and got it done
i didnt do that with project 2 and i was so lost
ugh

and the semester is halfway done now bc fall break is over?? thats so messed up 
i need to catch up on weekly notes
i still have unchecked fleeting notes from like week 2 because i still havent made math topic notes
does the topic note system suck>? or do i just never study? 
a little bit of both perhaps
