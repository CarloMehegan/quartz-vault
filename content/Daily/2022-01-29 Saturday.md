Terrible news after we played bedwars Ryan decided to start playing skyblock and we played until 5 am. I just got out of bed it's 4:32 pm. Not sure what to do with my day now I think first I should take a shower I lost my night shower streak and then I'll idk play skyblock my goal is to get one assignment done today

7:39 I've showered and made ramen the Lao Gan Ma I got isn't very spicy but I like it and I probably put too much actually also I turned in CS100 about me assignment now I'm going to draft my plan for the LING220 about me assignment I think what I want to do is make a flow chart showing things that influenced my language and why I signed up for this class after that idk I'll play skyblock
