### Tuesday, Feb 1
First week of school officially done
Timery stats from the last 7 days:

Gaming 29:19:00
Work 18:40:00
Reading 11:02:00
Caf 7:25:00
Social 7:17:00
Cleaning 0:16:00

Omitted: Routine because it doesn't mean anything and Obsidian because I haven't been tracking it

My goal of 16 hours of work this week is completed and yes that includes 13 hours of class but still I'm happy with that I'll do the same goal this week and increment it next week or the week after not sure technically I should start the week Monday and end Sunday but whatever I'll retroactively change that and do this update again on Sunday

Today was good I got up at 7:30 it was so hard but I did it and math lab went great and after I went to the caf and got breakfast which made my stomach hurt but just being up for breakfast is an accomplishment and while I was there I  completed the math lab so thats one less thing to worry about this week very awesome 

I also went to Food Lion for the first time it was great I bought nail clippers to replace the ones I lost and I also bought an extension cord to replace the one I left at home and I bought like thirty dollars of snacks it was great

Anyways it is 11:38 and I still have some things to do I still haven't written those notes and updated my school vault
- Add pages related to u-substitution
	- Use lecture notes, jan 31 daily page, and lab 1
- Add pages related to phonetics
	- Use handwritten notes and Prof. Cochrane's online notes
But those will wait until tomorrow because it is too late also
Tomorrow
- After ling go downtown and try to find cheap earbuds
I should've done this at food lion but I forgot
Anyways what I actually need to do tonight
- CS100 reading "Graphs, Maps, Trees" by Moretti
This is it I have it loaded into Kindle on my phone it says there are 371 locations and I don't remember how long a location is but that feels like a lot so I'm gonna read that in bed I guess maybe find an audio version? Also I had no idea I was supposed to read Nose which was the first reading I thought that would be tonight's homework but whatever the schedule is formatted weird anyways I got through class yesterday well enough without having read it there's a lot of kids in that class that love talking so I will just skim this and find the important parts maybe I can use obsidian to record annotations that would be so cute I can link things but like I probably wont do that Ill just try to read it and that is plenty of work already

Also it feels like there's no class tomorrow I just remembered that I have classes and I felt bewildered idk why but the day after is no class so that is awesome I will play skyblock for a reasonable amount of time and work on obsidian notes

Ok the conversion from pdf to Kindle did pretty well but it loses a lot of formatting so I have the pdf on my monitor and the Kindle version on my phone to highlight and take notes
