### Saturday, Feb 5
Today is good so far I got up at 10 and I was going to get in bed again but Anish texted me about robotics and I started watching the livestream and playing vampire slayers or whatever the game is called it looks like our robots are doing pretty good that's good news also the competition they were in is hosted at HHS this year so that's cool anyways at around 2 I went to the caf I was just gonna go there come back because I didn't wanna go out anywhere and I didn't wanna shower but I did I took a shower it was awesome and then went to the caf I was there until 4 pm and last night I sent a yikyak asking if there were any good study spaces and I only got one response it said the study rooms on the top floor of the ISC so I started walking there also my air pods died that sux I always forget to charge them anyways now I am here on the third floor I just spent a while walking around this building is still depressing even though it's the newest building but it does have some nice spots I'm sitting in a hallway nook by a big window that looks down on the entrance with the big stair it's nice here but I still don't know what study rooms the yikyak was talking about I might get up and look around or respond to the comment

Anyways the reason I am here is because I need to find a place where I can take notes I want a physical space that I can associate with note taking that is away from my dorm so I'm trying the ISC ok it is 4:18 I am gonna try to work on my math notes make some new pages and stuff for 10 minutes

I'm not sure how I want to structure these notes. I've been messing with Obsidian for 13 minutes trying to figure it out I think I like the idea of letting my notes structure themselves but I also want to have a directory file with links to everything. I also like structuring it like a wiki. Also my stomach hurts

It is 5:01 So far I've made a page for Even/Odd functions and I worked on a basic template for math topics. I'm pretty happy with the even odd page and I think I'll stick with the template for now.

5:35 Note to self: figure out how Daily Notes work and look at the Calendar community plug in

I've spent over an hour on calc notes and filling in pages I made before now here's a list of the pages I should make based on my notion daily notes
Pages to make:
- [x] Integration
- [x] Trigonometry / Unit Circle
- [x] FTC
- [x] Calc 1 Formulas
- [x] Phonetics
- [x] Cos squared plus sin squared = 1
- [x] Add tags like \#5.5
- [x] History of Russia?
- [x] 6.1 Area Between Curves
- [x] 6.2 Volumes
Now I just have to make these I prob wont do them all but yeah
5:54 I'm tired of this now I'm gonna walk around downtown and see what's open maybe get ice cream / soap / candy / peanuts


Update aug 24 I'm checking all the old checkboxes in files so I can start using the to do plugin
Ask of these were unchecked except FTC
