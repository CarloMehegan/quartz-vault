## Records of the Grand Historian
##### About
The [Records of the Grand Historian](Records%20of%20the%20Grand%20Historian.md) is a work by Sima Qian dating back to the first century BCE. It is one of the first Chinese historical texts, covering from the Xia dynasty to the Han dynasty. Sima Qian's writing was more objective than others, and didn't claim divine right as the reason emperors ruled. Besides emperors, the text covers economics and culture, and contains a section of biogrpahies of important historical figures. Chapter 124, in the biographies section, is titled "Youxia liezhuan," or "Biographies of Knights-Errant." This chapter describes knights operating on their own who are true to their word and save those in distress.

##### Notes
The chapter on Knights-Errant is likely the earliest surviving [Youxia](Youxia.md) story. The presence of this chapter shows how these kinds of characters have been present in Chinese literature from the beginning. While the whole text is not a youxia novel by any means, this chapter is an example of early youxia stories starting to become widespread.
