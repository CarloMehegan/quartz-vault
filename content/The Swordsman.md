## The Swordsman
##### About
[The Swordsman](The%20Swordsman.md) is a poem written by Jia Dao during the Tang Dynasty. This dynasty is well known for its contributions to poetry, and [Youxia](Youxia.md) influences can be seen in this poem and other poems from this dynasty, showing the growing popularity of these stories.

##### The Poem
Translation by [James Liu](http://www.jstor.org/stable/23881289)
**1**  **For ten long years, a sword I whetted,
2  Its frosty blade, as yet, untried.**
**3  Today, I hold it unsheathed before you;**
**4  Of you, to whom was justice denied?**

Another translation by [Traditionshome](https://100tangpoems.wordpress.com/2022/02/16/ten-years-to-forge-a-sword/)
**1 Ten years to sharpen a sword. 
2 Its sharp bright edge never tried.  
3 Today I show it to you, 
4 For whom justice was denied.**

##### Notes
This short poem reflects the [Youxia](Youxia.md) ideas of a wandering hero looking to serve justice. To me, the poem describes a warrior about to set out on a quest. President Xi Jinping [quoted this poem](http://en.people.cn/n3/2022/0212/c90000-9956834.html) at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, further showing the poem's prevalence and its themes of contest and cultivation.
