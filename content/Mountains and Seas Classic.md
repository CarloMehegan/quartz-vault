## Mountains and Seas Classic
##### About
The [Mountains and Seas Classic](Mountains%20and%20Seas%20Classic.md) is a work whose author is unknown. It is not in the form of a novel, and instead documents mountains, seas, medicines, animals, and more. Some of the descriptions of these things are straightforward, while others are more narrative and fantastical. Most of the animals described are mythological creatures, and much of the book describes myths.

##### Notes
The Mountains and Seas Classic is not a fantasy work itself, but some of the stories within it could be classified as early [Xianxia](Xianxia.md) stories because they involve common xianxia characteristics like immortal powers and travelling through China. Even if not a xianxia work itself, the Classic is an example of early Xianxia ideas starting to make their way into stories.
