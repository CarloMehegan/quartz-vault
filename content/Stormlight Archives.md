## Stormlight Archives
##### About
The [Stormlight Archives](Stormlight%20Archives.md) is a high fantasy book series written by Brandon Sanderson that is still in progress today. After Sanderson's work on finishing [The Wheel of Time](The%20Wheel%20of%20Time.md), the Stormlight Archives has been the biggest of his ongoing projects. The story focuses on a world called Roshar, whose magic stems from the influence of three gods, named Odium, Honor, and Cultivation.

##### Notes
The Stormlight Archives is very similar to [Xianxia](Xianxia.md) stories because of the themes of cultivation and characters starting weak and gaining godly powers. This work may be the earliest story considered part of the burgeoning [Progression Fantasy](Progression%20Fantasy.md) genre, which describes Western fantasy works with themes similar to xianxia. The intricate worldbuilding of The Stormlight Archives also shows the influence of [The Wheel of Time](The%20Wheel%20of%20Time.md), another story that takes ideas from Eastern works.
