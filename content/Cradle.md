## Cradle
##### About
[Cradle](Cradle.md) is a [Progression Fantasy](Progression%20Fantasy.md) series written by Will Wight that is still in progress today. The story follows a boy named Wei Shi Lindon who starts at the lowest rank of the world's martial arts magic system, and quickly progresses through stages of power as he uncovers the secrets of Cradle.

##### Notes
Of all of the works in this project, Cradle's inspiration from [Xianxia](Xianxia.md) works is the most evident. In interviews and blog posts, Will Wight has said that Cradle was a direct attempt in writing xianxia.

"Cradle was my humble, meager attempt to write a story in the xianxia* genre: a subcategory of Chinese novels that have grown popular on the English-speaking Internet over the last couple of years thanks to sites like [WuxiaWorld](http://www.wuxiaworld.com/) and [GravityTales](http://www.gravitytales.com/) (not to mention the hard-working, dedicated, good-looking fan translators who provide such works to lazy monolingual English-speakers like myself)."

There are many ways that Wight's story subverts xianxia tropes in his attempt to "Westernize" the genre. In the previously mentioned blog post, he notes that xianxia as it existed to English readers at the time was typically published serially online, with chapters translated at a similar pace. There were also issues with these works not being as progressive, for example, the recurring pattern of women being treated as subservient to the male protagonists. Will Wight's traditionally published series with female protagonists contrasts with the previous xianxia norm, leading to Western works like his being categorized under a new subgenre called [Progression Fantasy](Progression%20Fantasy.md).

Through progression fantasy works like Cradle and [Sufficiently Advanced Magic](Sufficiently%20Advanced%20Magic.md), we see how xianxia has evolved into a new Western genre.
