### Notes
During class, 50 minutes
Open notes, only class notes
Will have IPA to refer to
On Friday

Transcription:
- individual English words
- one word at a time
- watch handwriting
- words played out loud multiple times for the whole class to hear

Allomorphs
- [[Morphology II#Allomorphs]]
- more than one way to articulate the same morpheme
- if asked for all the allomorphs, might just be one, or could be multiple
- cats "cat" and "s" allomorphs

Allophones
- [[Phonology II - Phonemes#Allophones]]
- More than one way to say something
- underlyingly the same phoneme
- $[t]$ and flap represent $/t/$
- allo means more than one pronunciation of a thing
- remember "all"
- [[Morphology II#allophone vs allomorph]]
- phones or "sounds" within a morph
- "phones are at the sound level in phonology, morphs are at the word level in morphology"

Assimilation
- [[Morphology II#Assimilation]]
- there are multiple allomorphs for one phoneme because of pronunciation
- look at conditioning environment
	- the sounds are influenced by the surrounding sounds, become more similar to surrounding sounds
- "when a sound becomes more like a nearby sound in some phonetic way"
- ex. cupboard
- ex. moved vs left

Inflectional / Derivational
- [[Morphology I#Inflectional and Derivational Affixes]]
- inflectional - tweaking the meaning of the word, core meaning stays the same
	- ex. cats
	- [[Morphology I#common types of inflectional affixes]]
	- plurals, possessives, tense, gender, comparative/superlative, honorific
- derivational - give new words with their own meanings
	- ex. review, dislike
	- a review is not "to view again" its a critique/response/opinion which is kind of viewing something again but it changes the core meaning of the word view i guess
- inflectional is making a small change to a word to give it context
- conceptually derivational has to do with making new words in a language like television putting morphs together
- is cat vs cats different words? no but view and review are different words

Typology
- [[Morphology III#Typology]]
- looking at structure
- categorizing languages by their structure
- (doing typology with syntax in workshop on friday!)
- types
	- analytic/isolating
		- depending mostly on word order
		- mandarin chinese / cantonese
		- english is pretty analytic you can change the whole meaning of something by changing word order
		- man bite dog vs dog bite man
	- synthetic
		- use a lot of morphology but use it in different ways
		- types
			- fusional/inflecting
				- multiple meanings for a morph
				- like "ninas" or something "as" affix shows gender and shows plural would need to change to "a" or "os" or "o" to change meaning
			- agglutinating
				- only one meaning for each morph
				- one-ish meaning for morph and add multiple morphs to show each meaning
				- plural and gender would have their own affixes and you add both as needed
			- polysynthetic
				- long big words
				- different from agglutinating as you can just keep adding morphs

Ambiguity
- [[Syntax III#Ambiguity]]
- sentence could have multiple meanings
- ex "students hit the men with bats"
- could mean that students had bats or men had bats
- "men with bats" could be a constituent or not
- "men with bats" is all one noun phrase
- "with bats" is a prepositional phrase at the end of the verb phrase


### To do
Add all stuff on paper into obsidian so I have it all in one place
Practice phonetic transcription?
look at errors in assignments and compile a list of things to check
