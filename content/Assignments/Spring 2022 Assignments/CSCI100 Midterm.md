### Essays
 

A. Discuss Nikolai Gogol’s novella “The Nose” as an example of a “Petersburg tale.” What is the role of setting in “The Nose”? How does the setting contribute to the phantastic and absurdist aspects of the tale? Provide 2 specific examples. How does the narrative voice create ambiguity about the events and the characters?

B. Discuss folktales as a type of pre-modern narratives. How were folktales created and circulated? Who and when collected and published Russian folktales? What three _types_ of folktales did we discuss in class? List at least 3 stylistic features typical of folktales and provide examples from the Russian tales we read in the course.

Folktales are old stories that were passed down orally. These stories are often fantastical, follow similar structures, and were made to entertain or pass down lessons to the next generation. Because they were passed down orally, the full history of folktales are unknown, but a collection of Russian folktales was compiled and published in the 1800s by Alexander Afanasyev.

There are three major types of folktales: animal tales, wonder tales, and tales of everyday life. These folktales often involve a blending of reality and magical elements to tell a story. Because folktales evolved from other folktales over time, there are stylistic features that are common in a folktale. The magic number 3 is seen in stories like the The Frog Princess, where three wives, each married to one of the king's three sons, compete with each other in three different skills. The magic number three is also seen in Baba Yaga and the Brave Youth, where Baba Yaga has three daughters, and Vasilisa the Beautiful, where Vasilisa encounters three horsemen. These horsemen represent another stylistic feature of folktales: anthropomorphism. The horsemen represent the personification of day, the rising sun, and night. Other stories feature talking animals, like in The Goldfish, or inanimate objects brought to life, like Baba Yaga's house on chicken legs. A final example of a stylistic feature are fixed epithets. These are signature archetypes, like Holy Russia, brave youth, fair maiden, and wicked stepmother, that are used across many stories. These features help to identify folktales, and show how folktales evolved as a form of literature.

C. Discuss the _Primary Chronicle_ as a type of medieval writing. Who composed it and when? How is it different from modern historical accounts (consider, e.g., the first entry)? Briefly discuss “The Martyrdom of Boris and Gleb” and why they were canonized as saints.

D. Raskol’nikov’s last name in _Crime and Punishment_ means split/schism. What is his “split”? What are the two sides of his personality? What other characters embody one or the other side of this split? Provide specific examples.

Split
- uses an axe to split
- split between man and louse
- split between right and wrong
- split between wanting to confess and scared of punishment

Embodied by
- Svidrigailov
	- represents not confessing
	- finding how to stop caring
	- crime
- Porfiry, Sonia
	- confession
	- punishment

Raskolnikov's name meaning schism/split is very symbolic of his character. Throughout the book, he thinks one way and then acts another, or is torn between choices. We can see his split personality in many scenes, such as the scene on the bridge in part 1, where he helps a drunk girl by alerting an officer for help, and then turns and tells the officer to leave her on the street anyway. This scene shows how Raskolnikov is torn between his own instincts for compassion and his anger towards the world.

In Raskolnikov's essay, he writes about how extraordinary men are able to forego punishment for their crimes when they commit these crimes for the greater good. He highlights the split between man and louse, and when he commits his own crime, tries to prove that he is not the louse.

After Raskolnikov commits his crime, he is faced with another split: the choice to confess or not to confess. These choices are personified in the characters Svidrigailov and Porfiry Petrovich. In the later acts of the book, the two characters' conversations with Raskolnikov help him make his decision. Svidrigailov has committed many crimes and gotten away with them thanks to his wealth. He is at peace with his crimes, and is able to live beyond morality. Porfiry, the man investigating Raskolnikov's murder case, knows that Raskolnikov committed the crime and tells him to confess in order to recieve a lighter sentence and start on the path towards redemption. Raskolnikov battles with the idea of confession, fearing what his punishment will be.

These actions, ideas, and decisions that Raskolnikov wrestles with show how the meaning of his name fits his character. There are other ways in which this concept is used, such as the very literal use of a "splitting" axe as his murder weapon. Splitting becomes a motif used throughout the book to represent Raskolnikov's moral and spiritual struggles.





E. What is “distant reading”? How do its methods differ from those of the close human(istic) reading? What do the two types of reading have in common? How does Franco Moretti use the methods of distant reading in his chapter “Graphs” that we read in this course? What are his specific findings? Provide at least 2 examples.
