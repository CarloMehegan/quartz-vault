Prompt

How does the study of language in use intersect with other fields of study?Â How can it be applied in the real world?

Response

Linguistics has applications in computer science, specfically in natural language processing, but also in other areas, like the creation of programming languages. Search engines, text to speech, voice recognition, and spellcheck are all technologies that need to process human input and understand how people use language, and they use the structures and patterns we've studied in class in order to do this successfully. However, these technologies still have issues, and there is work that needs to be done to perfect language processing. 

Another area where the study of language applies is in creating programming languages themselves. All languages have their own syntax and rules in order to interface with a computer, and this needs to be taken into account in order to make a language accessible. However, making a programming language easier to read and understand can cause the commands to lose some of their nuance, and performance can worsen because of this. For example, Python is easier to read and write than Java, but Python is slower than Java. There's a balance act between making a language understandable to humans and understandable to machines, and linguistic principles are used in making the decisions of how to structure a programming language.
