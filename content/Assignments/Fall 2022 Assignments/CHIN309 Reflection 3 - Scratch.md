> [!Assignment]
> Please submit a reflection based on material we have covered through October 25th! Don't feel the need to cover everything. You can simply discuss your favorite piece, something interesting that came up in class, or even discuss how you've encountered the topics at hand outside of class.
> 
> **If you like you can use this as a project proposal for your final project!**
> 
> Tell me what your planned topic is, why you find it interesting, and describe the materials you plan to use (don't worry, you can change your mind about your project at any time). If your project is not easy to translate into a word-count, propose an alternative way of assessing total content, **and I will consider your proposal and let you know what the plan is.**

**At least one of your essays MUST reflect on the differences between the social role the literature we discuss and the role of literature in a western context.**

	- "Between the [1960s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960s "1960s") and [1980s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s "1980s"), the genre entered a [golden age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age "Golden age"). Writers such as [Liang Yusheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liang_Yusheng "Liang Yusheng") and Louis Cha ([Jin Yong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Yong "Jin Yong")) spearheaded the founding of a "new school" of the wuxia genre that differed largely from its predecessors. They wrote serials for newspapers and magazines. They also incorporated several fictional themes such as mystery and romance from other cultures."
- Xianxia wikipedia
	- "_Xianxia_ is often compared to the *wuxia* genre, and often shares many similarities - being set in a quasi-historical ancient China, featuring larger-than-life protagonists, and so on. The main difference is that _xianxia_ generally has a much larger focus on spiritual growth and powers, multiple realms of reality, interacting with spirits and immortals, and so on; while _wuxia_ is somewhat more grounded."
