idea:
- connecting "The Way" and "Cultivation" ideas to their portrayal in modern fiction
- where do these ideas show up in the readings?
	- the way - daoist idea - literally the dao
	- zhuangzi - cook ding - connection to the way allows him to perfect his craft
	- dao de jing - "the book of the way and of virtue"
	- the way cannot be fully explained, indescribable
	- people should act in accordance with the way
	- water is close to the way - it does not try to be anything it is not
	- dao vs confucius - the dao is something that just is - for confucius people need to act in order for things to go well
	- daoist idea of inaction - follow along with the seasons - dont actively persue - dont do anything outside of the flow of the way
	- knowledge, desire, brings you away from the way
- where do these ideas show up in fiction?
	- will wight's *Cradle* series
	- xianxia/wuxia
	- idk the mandalorian?
- Cradle's magic system, and how The Way in cradle relates to The Way in our readings
	- The way is a fundamental force of reality, makes reality stable, creates order
	- The way is stronger around intelligent beings like humans
	- The more people together, the stronger the way is
	- When the way is weak, falls apart, gives way to chaos
	- People with extremely strong will can tap into the way and manipulate reality
		- ideas of immortality, flying on clouds, ideas seen in the readings, comparable to power gained from a strong connection to the way in the world of cradle
	- Icons - When a sacred artist becomes strong enough to touch the way, they may manifest an Icon, representing an attribute of reality they are highly attuned to
	- Icons allow artists to manipulate the way in ways that attune with their authority
	- Cultivation - The main philosophy of a sacred artist's journey is to refine and perfect themselves
	- A path is a set of techniques that focus on a specific attribute of reality / madra type that sacred artists use and pass down to other sacred artists
	- The most famous quote from the series
		- "There are a million Paths in this world, Lindon, but any sage will tell you they can all be reduced to one. Improve yourself."
	- Many stages of advancement within the magic system before sacred artists are strong enough to attune to the Way
	- Sacred artists are strong enough to reach the Way by the end of the Lord stage
	- At this point, advancement relies not only on cultivation of power, but on inner reflection and self revelation.
	- A sacred artist must have revelations about themself in the past, the present, and the future in order to reach the peak of the Lord stage, at which point their willpower may be strong enough to manifest an Icon.

Summary
- Throughout our readings this semester, we have seen the Daoist idea of "The Way" talked about multiple times. 
- In the Dao De Jing, the Dao, or the Way, is the indescribable natural order of the universe. When someone acts in accordance with the Dao, they follow the flow of reality, act at the right time, do not persue knowledge, and avoid desire.
- In the writings of Zhuangzi, a butcher has a strong enough connection to the Way that he can cut an ox with perfect precision. The butcher is not a scholar, yet has honed his craft to such an extent that he has formed a connection to the Way.
- Zhuangzi also uses immortality, flying on clouds, and other supernatural abilities to describe those close to the Way. These ideas were likely used as metaphors, but many people who practiced Daoism after Zhuangzi's time believed they could attain these powers.
- This interpretation of the Way as a means of cultivating power is seen even today in fiction genres like progression fantasy, xianxia, and wuxia. These works typically have magic systems and stories that revolve around individuals cultivating power and becoming strong enough to manipulate reality.
- The biggest and most accessible work from this category of fiction is Will Wight's *Cradle* series.
- *Cradle*'s influence from Daoist ideas is explicit: the magic system is based on a force called The Way.
- In the series, The Way makes reality stable and creates order. 
- It is strengthened by the presence of humans and other forms of intelligent life, and places in the universe with a high concentration of people have a stronger connection to the Way.
- People with extremely strong wills are able to tap into the Way and manipulate reality. Typically, once they are able to do this, they are too powerful for their homeworld and must "ascend." Without too many spoilers, the protagonist's goal in *Cradle* is to cultivate his willpower to this level.
- This cultivation is what the series focuses on, and it comes in many facets. Typically this is done through strengthening one's spirit by cultivating aura and advancing through stages of strength. The people who perform these practices are called sacred artists. 
- By the Lord stage, the final stage before being able to attune to the Way, sacred artists must not only cultivate physical strength, but look inwards and find revelations about themselves. 
- After these revelations are found, sacred artists may manifest icons. Icons represent the identity and peak of skill a sacred artists has reached. 
- Much like the butcher who can attune to the Way and perfectly cut an ox, these sacred artists can tap into the Way in order to manipulate reality in ways that attune with their identity. As a sacred artist comes closer to the Way, they perfect their very identity, and the weight of their existence can warp the fabric of reality.
- Much like the ideas of immortality than Zhuangzi mentioned, those that follow the Way in *Cradle* are able to become one with it.

"There are a million Paths in this world, Lindon, but any sage will tell you they can all be reduced to one. Improve yourself."
