Notes on documentary  Since I first got a sense of myself I considered myself a Korean even though I wasn&rsquo;t sure what it meant We are in educational front line of Chongnyeon, an association of pro North Korean residents in japan providing national identity to our students &mldr; a lifeline Seems like everybody&rsquo;s having a good time Students speak Japanese better  connects to that thing from linguistics It&rsquo;s more useful to speak japanese like when that dad taught his kid Klingon to see if he could learn it and he did but he stopped using it and eventually forgot once he went to school and interacted with more people; English was more useful and used everywhere these kids don&rsquo;t use Korean outside of school   The Korean we use is becoming a localized language Wearing traditional costume in Hokkaido s chilly weather is not easy In South Korea you can passively keep your identity you don&rsquo;t need to exhibit it but for Korean residents in Japan if you don&rsquo;t demonstrate it it will fade away - You are becoming Japanese inside and out and you lose your sense of identity that&rsquo;s why we have to wear traditional costume and stick to the Korean language Why do boys wear blazers and not traditional costume One of the students made a joke ab a South Korean actor they probably like Nice school bus Seems like they&rsquo;re all well-off Now ~30-40 studwnts in the dorms, at one point >200 Spent 12 years from primary to high school in their dorm Teachers are passionate I could not spend all day and night around kids &ldquo;But now it is so quiet&rdquo; :doom: 12th grade won the singing contest Practice words in learning Korean: close, sickle, fatherland One on one policy pairing a transfer student with another student to interpret what teacher is saying bc transfer students have to catch up in learning korean Student that transferred in tenth grade - &ldquo;I hated being Korean&rdquo;, denied she was Korean, didn&rsquo;t understand why she was even Korean, &ldquo;I should have been born Japanese&rdquo; &ldquo;If you speak in Japanese you lose a point&rdquo; &ldquo;My classmates couldn&rsquo;t speak to me in Japanese because they would also lose a point, so I couldn&rsquo;t say anything&rdquo; But then class president said you won&rsquo;t lose points for speaking Japanese with a transfer student &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed since I came here&rdquo; school left them better off as a person &ldquo;A very strong sense of identity&rdquo; Around 45:30 mark we hear a first generation parent talk about the history We have to achieve unification of Korea as soon as possible, we are stronger when we&rsquo;re united Teachers visit families including far away ones during the summer Try to get more students during these trips One of the parents said &ldquo;it is us who are growing up, we are growing up together&rdquo; &ldquo;This recruiting trip gets harder and harder as I get old, because you feel empathy for the parents."><title>ðŸª´ Quartz 3.3</title><meta name=viewport content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"><link rel="shortcut icon" type=image/png href=https://carlomehegan.github.io/quartz-vault//icon.png><link href=https://carlomehegan.github.io/quartz-vault/styles.706bb6073ba85d26809f9096dae23a6b.min.css rel=stylesheet><link href=https://carlomehegan.github.io/quartz-vault/styles/_light_syntax.86a48a52faebeaaf42158b72922b1c90.min.css rel=stylesheet id=theme-link><script src=https://carlomehegan.github.io/quartz-vault/js/darkmode.d3b63235d6779582e069a9e8e0f62a2e.min.js></script>

What do I say even</p><p>Our School follows a North Korean school for children living in Hokkaido. The documentary gave me a feeling similar to the feeling I get from American Southern Gothic literature; an underlying sense of division and grief among this group of people. In Southern Gothic works this feeling comes from seeing people recuperating their lives after the Civil War, still suffering from the effects it had on them and trying to suppress these issues. The feeling is similar here because the conflict the school faces is only mentioned briefly a few times during the second half of the documentary, where it can&rsquo;t be avoided anymore. We see multiple types of division, including the division that comes from Japan&rsquo;s efforts to naturalize first generation Koreans, like the parents of the students in the documentary, and then from Japanese activists protesting against the North Korean school. We even see the division between North and South Korea, and hear how the students wish that one day the country would be united so that they can live in peace.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://carlomehegan.github.io/quartz-vault/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Jacky Zhao using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, Â© 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://carlomehegan.github.io/quartz-vault/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
