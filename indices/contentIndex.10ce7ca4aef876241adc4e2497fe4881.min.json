{"/":{"title":"","content":"## Final Project: Chinese Hero Fantasy\nThis site is organized into a timeline of fantasy novels, either Chinese fantasy works or works inspired by Chinese fantasy. Specifically, Chinese \"hero\" fantasy, a term used in this project to describe the fantasy \"-xia\" subgenres such as [Youxia](Youxia.md) and the subgenres that stem from them. See the [Genres](Genres.md) page for more information on these genres, with an explanation of their evolution throughout history that can serve as an alternate way of viewing this project.\n\nThis project details how Eastern fantasy has had an increasing influence on Western fantasy works over time, and especially in recent years, by going through specific works one by one. Each page contains a description of the plot, history of the work, and notes on how the work contributes to the main idea of growing influence. The interactive graph at the bottom of each page displays the links and backlinks between that page and others, effectively showing how topics are connected.\n\n## Timeline\n##### c. 100 BCE\n[Mountains and Seas Classic](Mountains%20and%20Seas%20Classic.md)  \n[Records of the Grand Historian](Records%20of%20the%20Grand%20Historian.md)   \n##### c. 800 CE\n[The Swordsman](The%20Swordsman.md)  \n##### c. 1400 CE\n[Water Margin](Water%20Margin.md)  \n##### 1592\n[Journey to the West](Journey%20to%20the%20West.md)  \n##### 1957 \n[Legends of the Condor Heroes](Legends%20of%20the%20Condor%20Heroes.md)  \n##### 1990\n[The Wheel of Time](The%20Wheel%20of%20Time.md)  \n##### 2010\n[Stormlight Archives](Stormlight%20Archives.md)  \n##### 2011\n[Mother of Learning](Mother%20of%20Learning.md)  \n##### 2016\n[Cradle](Cradle.md)  \n##### 2017\n[Sufficiently Advanced Magic](Sufficiently%20Advanced%20Magic.md)  \n##### 2018\n[Legends of the Condor Heroes English Translation](Legends%20of%20the%20Condor%20Heroes.md#English%20Publication)  \n##### 2022\n[The Swordsman quoted at the Olympics](The%20Swordsman.md)   \n[Mother of Learning Print Publication](Mother%20of%20Learning.md)   \n\n## Genres\nSee the [Genres](Genres.md) page for descriptions of each genres, or use the interactive graph on each genre's page to see which works a genre is connected to.\n[Youxia](Youxia.md)    \n[Wuxia](Wuxia.md)    \n[Xianxia](Xianxia.md)       \n[LitRPG](LitRPG.md)  \n[Progression Fantasy](Progression%20Fantasy.md)  \n\n## Notes\nI planned to format the timeline in a more dynamic way, but unfortunately was unable to get it to display on the website itself.

What I enjoy the most about this format is that it can be infinitely expanded, and with more time I could continue to flesh out this site.","lastmodified":"2022-12-16T21:40:00.305541535Z","tags":null},"/Cradle":{"title":"Cradle","content":"## Cradle\n##### About\n[Cradle](Cradle.md) is a [Progression Fantasy](Progression%20Fantasy.md) series written by Will Wight that is still in progress today. The story follows a boy named Wei Shi Lindon who starts at the lowest rank of the world's martial arts magic system, and quickly progresses through stages of power as he uncovers the secrets of Cradle.\n\n##### Notes\nOf all of the works in this project, Cradle's inspiration from [Xianxia](Xianxia.md) works is the most evident. In interviews and blog posts, Will Wight has said that Cradle was a direct attempt in writing xianxia.\n\n\"Cradle was my humble, meager attempt to write a story in the xianxia* genre: a subcategory of Chinese novels that have grown popular on the English-speaking Internet over the last couple of years thanks to sites like [WuxiaWorld](http://www.wuxiaworld.com/) and [GravityTales](http://www.gravitytales.com/) (not to mention the hard-working, dedicated, good-looking fan translators who provide such works to lazy monolingual English-speakers like myself).\"\n\\- *Will Wight on Cradle's origins [in his blog](https://www.willwight.com/a-blog-of-dubious-intent/the-ancestors-of-cradle).*\n\nThere are many ways that Wight's story subverts xianxia tropes in his attempt to \"Westernize\" the genre. In the previously mentioned blog post, he notes that xianxia as it existed to English readers at the time was typically published serially online, with chapters translated at a similar pace. There were also issues with these works not being as progressive, for example, the recurring pattern of women being treated as subservient to the male protagonists. Will Wight's traditionally published series with female protagonists contrasts with the previous xianxia norm, leading to Western works like his being categorized under a new subgenre called [Progression Fantasy](Progression%20Fantasy.md).\n\nThrough progression fantasy works like Cradle and [Sufficiently Advanced Magic](Sufficiently%20Advanced%20Magic.md), we see how xianxia has evolved into a new Western genre.\n\n![](Assets/Pasted%20image%2020221216152225.png)\n*The cover of the third Cradle collection, made up of the 7-9th books.*","lastmodified":"2022-12-16T21:40:00.305541535Z","tags":null},"/Genres":{"title":"Genres","content":"This page explains the genres used to categorize the works discussed in this project, and also acts as a way to view the project in prose, separate from the timeline on the main page.\n\n## Genres\nThis project focuses on specific subgenres of fantasy and how they evolve over time. These genres are referred to in the project as \"hero fantasy\" genres because of the suffix \"-xia,\" meaning \"hero,\" that follows some of them.\n\nThese genres can be traced back you [Youxia](Youxia.md), meaning \"Wandering Hero.\" Youxia is used as a loose description for early fantasy works that follow knight errant/wandering vigilante characters that seek to create justice as they travel around China. These heroes usually travel alone and solve problems according to their own moral compass and set of ethics. Youxia characteristics are seen in [Tang Dynasty poetry](The%20Swordsman.md) and even in works as far back as [Records of the Grand Historian](Records%20of%20the%20Grand%20Historian.md).\n\nFrom youxia comes [Wuxia](Wuxia.md), a more well-defined, structured genre. Wuxia translates to \"Martial Hero,\" and wuxia stories contain strong martial arts heroes and influence from philosophies like Daoism and Buddhism. What distinguishes wuxia from future genres is that these martial powers are still fairly grounded in reality, and the stories are often set in historical settings. An early example of wuxia storytelling is in the [Water Margin](Water%20Margin.md), where a band of outlaws fight against corruption. The genre truly came to prominence in the 20th century with works like [Legends of the Condor Heroes](Legends%20of%20the%20Condor%20Heroes.md).\n\n[Xianxia](Xianxia.md) is a subgenre of wuxia, translating to \"Immortal Hero.\" Where Wuxia's combat focused on (mostly) grounded martial arts, xianxia's heroes gain supernatural powers over the course of their story and combat is larger than life. Where a wuxia hero might be able to clear out a room of combatants with ease, a xianxia hero could level a mountain in one blow. The roots of these stories are seen as far back as the first century BCE in works like the [Mountains and Seas Classic](Mountains%20and%20Seas%20Classic.md), which take inspiration for godly powers from Daoist ideals. Another early work that influenced the genre as a whole is [Journey to the West](Journey%20to%20the%20West.md) with the story of Sun Wukong's rise and fall. The modern xianxia genre ballooned in prominence with the advent of the internet and online story publishing websites. [Mother of Learning](Mother%20of%20Learning.md), for example, was first published serially on websites like [RoyalRoad](https://www.royalroad.com/home) and [WuxiaWorld](https://www.wuxiaworld.com) before becoming popular enough to be traditionally published.\n\nDigital publishing allowed for Chinese fantasy to reach a wider global audience than ever before. With these works easily available, more attention was drawn to them as the online fantasy community grew, which led to Chinese works being translated into other languages. This accessibility allowed the community to grow even further, leading to more translations and more writers from outside of China. With all of these new works coming from vastly different perspectives around the world, as well as influence from non-Chinese works like shonen anime, new subgenres of xianxia were created. These include Cultivation, focusing on the process of heroes gaining power, and [LitRPG](LitRPG.md), where characters gain power through an RPG-like interface. An example of litRPG is Andrew Rowe's [Sufficiently Advanced Magic](Sufficiently%20Advanced%20Magic.md), a digitally published series which was actually written by an American author.\n\nAs the influence of Chinese fantasy grew, English-speaking authors began to draw influence from these works into their own stories. The Westernized genre that evolved from xianxia has been coined as [Progression Fantasy](Progression%20Fantasy.md) by its community. Works like [Sufficiently Advanced Magic](Sufficiently%20Advanced%20Magic.md) amd [Cradle](Cradle.md) fall under this genre, which focuses on characters starting weak and gaining exponential amounts of power throughout their story. The [Stormlight Archives](Stormlight%20Archives.md) and [The Wheel of Time](The%20Wheel%20of%20Time.md) series are also considered progression fantasy. The influence these Western works take from their Eastern counterparts is clear in the themes, tropes, and history they share.","lastmodified":"2022-12-16T21:40:00.305541535Z","tags":null},"/Journey-to-the-West":{"title":"Journey to the West","content":"## Journey to the West\n##### About\n[Journey to the West](Journey%20to%20the%20West.md) is a Chinese novel written by Wu Cheng'en during the Ming Dynasty. The novel follows the journey of the monk Xuanzang and his travelling companions as they travel to India to retrieve Buddhist scriptures. Along the way, they face many challenges and obstacles, including demons and monsters, as they try to protect the monk and fulfill their mission. This work conveys early [Xianxia](Xianxia.md) characteristics, particularly with the story of Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, and his rapid cultivation of godly powers throughout his story. Journey to the West is one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature and is considered a masterpiece of Chinese vernacular fiction. \n\n##### Notes\nThis story likely has the largest impact on Western culture of all of the works discussed in this project. Countless adaptations have been made, and Journey to the West's DNA can be found in works ranging from *Dragon Ball* to [Stormlight Archives](Stormlight%20Archives.md) to *Overwatch*. An entire project like this could be made by taking a deep dive into this work and exploring its influence throughout history.\n\n![](Assets/Pasted%20image%2020221216004423.png)\n*Sun Wukong's portrait in SMITE, where he is a playable god.*","lastmodified":"2022-12-16T21:40:00.305541535Z","tags":null},"/Legends-of-the-Condor-Heroes":{"title":"Legends of the Condor Heroes","content":"## Legends of the Condor Heroes\n##### About\n[Legends of the Condor Heroes](Legends%20of%20the%20Condor%20Heroes.md) is a [Wuxia](Wuxia.md) novel written by Jin Yong, pen name for the late Louis Cha. The novel follows the adventures of two young men, Guo Jing and Yang Kang, who become sworn brothers and embark on a series of dangerous quests. The novel is set in the Song Dynasty, and the story revolves around the conflict between the Song Empire and the invading Jurchen Jin Dynasty.\n\n##### English Publication\nThe novel was published for the first time in English across 4 volumes starting in 2018. The translation was done by Anna Holmwood.\n\n\"Considering that he has sold in the hundreds of millions and his reputation extends over most of East Asia, it is astonishing that it has taken sixty years to get here.

The story follows a student of a magical academy who gets stuck in a time loop. In order to escape, he has to hone his power and learn more about the world and the forces that trapped him.\n\n##### Notes\n[Mother of Learning](Mother%20of%20Learning.md) is one of the most, if not the most successful of the thousands of digitally published xianxia stories available online. One interesting thing about this story is that it was not written by a Chinese writer and translated to English—it was written by a Croatian writer. This shows how widespread the [Xianxia](Xianxia.md) community was by the time Kurmaic had started writing the series.\n\nThe series became successful enough that in 2022, a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wraithmarked/motheroflearningarc1/description) was created to print the series, a rarity for xianxia works like this one. The goal of $10,000 was reached in 67 minutes, and the total amount sits at $126,176 as of December 15, 2022. This huge funding success shows the enormous community around xianxia and [Progression Fantasy](Progression%20Fantasy.md) works.

Sima Qian's writing was more objective than others, and didn't claim divine right as the reason emperors ruled. Besides emperors, the text covers economics and culture, and contains a section of biogrpahies of important historical figures. Chapter 124, in the biographies section, is titled \"Youxia liezhuan,\" or \"Biographies of Knights-Errant.\" This chapter describes knights operating on their own who are true to their word and save those in distress.\n\n##### Notes\nThe chapter on Knights-Errant is likely the earliest surviving [Youxia](Youxia.md) story.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-16T21:40:00.305541535Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated!\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e [!INFO] Docker Support\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have Docker installed already, open your terminal, navigate to your folder with Quartz and run `make docker`\n\nNow that you are happy with how your Quartz instance looks, let's get it hosted!\n\n\u003e 🌍 Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](notes/hosting.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-16T21:40:00.309541614Z","tags":null},"/notes/search":{"title":"Search","content":"\nQuartz supports two modes of searching through content.\n\n## Full-text\nFull-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index. Enjoy natural language search powered by Operand!\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-16T21:40:00.309541614Z","tags":null},"/notes/setup":{"title":"Setup","content":"\n## Making your own Quartz\nSetting up Quartz requires a basic understanding of `git`. If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\n📁 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat! Now you have everything you need to start editing and growing your digital garden. If you're ready to start writing content already, check out the recommended flow for editing notes in Quartz.\n\n\u003e ✏️ Step 2: [Editing Notes in Quartz](notes/editing.md)\n\nHaving problems?

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2022-12-16T21:40:00.309541614Z","tags":null},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
