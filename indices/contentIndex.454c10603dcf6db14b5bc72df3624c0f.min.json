Improve yourself.\"\n\t- Many stages of advancement within the magic system before sacred artists are strong enough to attune to the Way\n\t- Sacred artists are strong enough to reach the Way by the end of the Lord stage\n\t- At this point, advancement relies not only on cultivation of power, but on inner reflection and self revelation.\n\t- A sacred artist must have revelations about themself in the past, the present, and the future in order to reach the peak of the Lord stage, at which point their willpower may be strong enough to manifest an Icon.\n\nSummary\n- Throughout our readings this semester, we have seen the Daoist idea of \"The Way\" talked about multiple times. \n- In the Dao De Jing, the Dao, or the Way, is the indescribable natural order of the universe. When someone acts in accordance with the Dao, they follow the flow of reality, act at the right time, do not persue knowledge, and avoid desire.\n- In the writings of Zhuangzi, a butcher has a strong enough connection to the Way that he can cut an ox with perfect precision. The butcher is not a scholar, yet has honed his craft to such an extent that he has formed a connection to the Way.\n- Zhuangzi also uses immortality, flying on clouds, and other supernatural abilities to describe those close to the Way. These ideas were likely used as metaphors, but many people who practiced Daoism after Zhuangzi's time believed they could attain these powers.\n- This interpretation of the Way as a means of cultivating power is seen even today in fiction genres like progression fantasy, xianxia, and wuxia. These works typically have magic systems and stories that revolve around individuals cultivating power and becoming strong enough to manipulate reality.\n- The biggest and most accessible work from this category of fiction is Will Wight's *Cradle* series.\n- *Cradle*'s influence from Daoist ideas is explicit: the magic system is based on a force called The Way.\n- In the series, The Way makes reality stable and creates order. \n- It is strengthened by the presence of humans and other forms of intelligent life, and places in the universe with a high concentration of people have a stronger connection to the Way.\n- People with extremely strong wills are able to tap into the Way and manipulate reality. Typically, once they are able to do this, they are too powerful for their homeworld and must \"ascend.\" Without too many spoilers, the protagonist's goal in *Cradle* is to cultivate his willpower to this level.\n- This cultivation is what the series focuses on, and it comes in many facets. Typically this is done through strengthening one's spirit by cultivating aura and advancing through stages of strength. The people who perform these practices are called sacred artists. \n- By the Lord stage, the final stage before being able to attune to the Way, sacred artists must not only cultivate physical strength, but look inwards and find revelations about themselves. \n- After these revelations are found, sacred artists may manifest icons. Icons represent the identity and peak of skill a sacred artists has reached. \n- Much like the butcher who can attune to the Way and perfectly cut an ox, these sacred artists can tap into the Way in order to manipulate reality in ways that attune with their identity. As a sacred artist comes closer to the Way, they perfect their very identity, and the weight of their existence can warp the fabric of reality.\n- Much like the ideas of immortality than Zhuangzi mentioned, those that follow the Way in *Cradle* are able to become one with it.\n\n\"There are a million Paths in this world, Lindon, but any sage will tell you they can all be reduced to one.

[[2022-10-12 Wednesday]] 16:59:35\ndescription::\n\nGoal\n- in class we analyzed poetry from the Tang Dynasty through close reading\n- I want to analyze Tang poetry through distant reading\n- My goal was to take a large collection of Tang poetry and find what characters showed up most frequently throughout the works.\n\nFinding the poems\n- I wanted to find a large collection of Tang poetry, in .txt form, containing the poets we discussed in class\n- Found a collection called *Three Hundred Tang Poems*\n- Project Gutenberg had a .txt version in Chinese and an audio version with an English table of contents.\n\t- https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52323\n\t- https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20968\n- Using the English table of contents (and Google Translate), I found that this work contained some of the poets we discussed in class, such as Li Bai, Du Fu, and Wang Wei\n- Isolated just the poetry and used that as the data set\n\nMaking the Wordclouds\n- started by making a wordcloud\n- https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud\n- https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/auto_examples/wordcloud_cn.html\n- First wordcloud, no formatting, wanted to see what stuck out\n\t- Biggest strings of characters were author names\n- Next wordcloud, separated each character so that the wordcloud would represent character frequency instead\n- realized i cant make any sense of this so i need to print the most common characters\n\nTranslating to English and Refining the Data\n- In order to analyze these characters I needed to translate them to English, so I used another script to give me the most frequent characters and how often they appear.\n- I found that author names were one source of data contamination, and removed them from the .txt file\n- Google Translate definitely was not able to translate some characters properly, but this list still conveys some of the common themes used in the 300 poems\n\nThemes\n- Nature, seen through words like Sun, Night, Sky, Wind, Cloud, Green, Autumn, Horse\n\t- A theme we first found prevalent in poetry from the Six Dynasties Period\n\t- Continues into this dynasty, such as in the nature descriptions Du Fu uses in poems like *A Song on How My Thatched Roof Was Ruined by the Autumn Wind*\n\t- Mountain is much higher than I thought it would be\n- Passage of time, seen through words like Month, Year, Ancient, Today, Sun, Night, Autumn, Long, Time\n- Dao/Way, mentioned 50 times\n\t- We've talked about Daoism in class, and it's interesting to see it show up so frequently in these poems\n\t- Is it being mentioned by multiple poets, or one or two poets that focused on Daoism?\n\t\t- After looking through the data, mentions of 道 are pretty spread out\n\t\t- Poems are organized by author for the most part, so no, it must be from multiple poets\n- No mentions of wine/drinking\n\t- I thought we'd see more because of its frequent mention in Li Bai's poems\n\n\n![[CHIN309_fig1.png]]![[CHIN309_fig2.png]]![[CHIN309_fig3.png]]\n\n30 most common, before splitting into characters\n```\n[('作者：杜甫', 39), ('作者：李白', 34), ('作者：王維', 29), ('作者：李商隱', 24),

My goal for this reflection was to take a large collection of Tang poetry and analyze it through distant reading by looking at word frequency.\n\n##### Finding poems\nI wanted to find a large collection of Tang poetry, in .txt form, containing the poets we discussed in class. Fortunately I was able to find a collection quickly called *Three Hundred Tang Poems*. Project Gutenberg had a .txt version in Chinese and an audio version with an English table of contents. Using the English table of contents (and Google Translate), I found that this work contained some of the poets we discussed in class, such as Li Bai, Du Fu, and Wang Wei. I downloaded the .txt and cut it down to just the poems to create the data set.\n\n##### Making the wordclouds\nI started by running the poems through a script to create a wordcloud showing the most frequent strings of characters as larger. The first wordcloud I created was to make sure the script was working.\n\n![[Pasted image 20221022230416.png]]\n\nI wasn't able to discern much from this graphic. The wordcloud was showing the most frequent combinations of characters instead of the most frequent characters. So next, I split the .txt file by character and made another wordcloud.\n\n![[Pasted image 20221022231246.png]]\n\nRemoving collocations, reducing number of characters shown to 100:\n\n![[Pasted image 20221022232153.png]]\n\nThis graphic was more useful, but at this point I realized I don't speak Chinese, so I needed a way of translating these characters. To do this, I made another script that printed the most frequent characters along with how many times they appeared.\n\n```\n100 most common characters and their frequencies\n\n[('，', 1580), ('。', 1321), ('作', 351), ('者', 346), ('：', 322), ('不', 222), ('人', 214), ('山', 175), ('1', 172), ('0', 170), ('2', 163), ('？', 151), ('無', 134), ('一', 133), ('月', 130), ('日', 127), ('；', 123), ('夜', 120), ('天', 120), ('風', 117), ('白', 117), ('長', 112), ('來', 105), ('雲', 104), ('上', 102), ('有', 98), ('春', 95), (7', 94), ('何', 92), ('行', 92), ('之', 91), ('生', 91), ('君', 90), ('李', 87), ('中', 87), ('水', 87), ('見', 85), ('花', 85), ('時', 84), ('王', 84), ('3', 83), ('下', 79), ('青', 79), ('歸', 78), ('如', 78), ('秋', 75), ('明', 72), ('萬', 72), ('三', 71), ('為', 71), ('落', 71), ('空', 70), ('自', 67), ('此', 64), ('金', 63), ('雨', 63), ('4', 62), ('5', 62), ('6', 62), ('7', 62), ('8', 62), ('9', 62), ('去', 62), ('今', 61), ('馬', 60), ('南', 59), ('杜', 59), ('城', 59), ('欲', 59), ('家', 58), ('將', 58), ('西', 58), ('古', 58), ('年', 58), ('未', 57), ('子', 57), ('門', 57), ('在', 56), ('心', 56), ('清', 56), ('飛', 56), ('寒', 56), ('聲', 56), ('客', 55), ('事', 54), ('處', 54), ('別', 54), ('朝', 54), ('高', 53), ('陽', 53), ('黃', 52), ('玉', 51), ('大', 51), ('入', 50), ('與', 50), ('出', 50), ('道', 50), ('望', 49), ('十', 49)]\n\nRan through Google Translate\n\n[(',', 1580), ('.', 1321), ('do', 351), ('who', 346), (':', 322), ('no', 222), ( 'person', 214), ('mountain', 175), ('1', 172), ('0', 170), ('2', 163), ('?', 151), ('none ', 134), ('one', 133), ('month', 130), ('day', 127), (';', 123), ('night', 120), ('day', 120), ('wind', 117), ('white', 117), ('long', 112), ('come', 105), ('cloud', 104), ('on', 102) , ('you', 98), ('spring', 95), ('jiang', 95), ('xiang', 94), ('he', 92), ('line', 92), ( 'zhi', 91), ('sheng', 91), ('jun', 90), ('li', 87), ('zhong', 87), ('water', 87), ('see ', 85), ('flower', 85), ('time', 84), ('king', 84), ('3', 83), ('lower', 79), ('green', 79), ('Return', 78), ('Ru', 78), ('Autumn', 75), ('Ming', 72), ('Wan', 72), ('Three', 71) , ('wei', 71), ('fall', 71), ('empty', 70), ('si', 67), ('this', 64), ('jin', 63), ( 'rain', 63), ('4', 62), ('5', 62), ('6', 62), ('7', 62), ('8', 62), ('9 ', 62), ('go', 62), ('now', 61), ('ma', 60), ('nan', 59), ('du', 59), ('city', 59), ('desire', 59), ('home', 58), ('will', 58), ('west', 58), ('ancient', 58), ('year', 58) , ('wei', 57), ('zi', 57), ('door', 57), ('zai', 56), ('xin', 56), ('clear', 56), ( 'Fly', 56), ('Cold', 56), ('Sound', 56), ('Guest', 55), ('Thing', 54), ('Location', 54), ('Don't ', 54), ('towards' , 54), ('High', 53), ('Yang', 53), ('Yellow', 52), ('Jade', 51), ('Big', 51), ('In', 50 ), ('and', 50), ('out', 50), ('dao', 50), ('look', 49), ('ten', 49)]\n```\n\nNext, I spent a while trying to format the data to make a graph (with the first two most common characters, the comma and period, removed):\n\n![[Pasted image 20221022191816.png]]\n\nThen I realized that some of the characters in the list were from the names of the authors, which got left in the dataset. I also realized that Google Translate was combining some of the characters and the translation was fluctuating from instance to instance, so I added periods between each word in the word list and translated it in sections, making sure I got 100 English words to match the 100 characters. Eventually, I had this list:\n\n```\n[('，', 1580), ('。', 1321), ('不', 222), ('人', 213), ('山', 175), ('1', 172), ('0', 170), ('2', 163), ('？', 151), ('一', 133), ('無', 133), ('月', 130), ('日', 127), ('；', 123), ('夜', 120), ('天', 120), ('風', 117), ('來', 105), ('雲', 104), ('上', 102), ('長', 101), ('有', 98), ('江', 95), ('春', 94), ('相', 94), ('何', 92), ('行', 92), ('生', 91), ('君', 90), ('之', 88), ('水', 87), ('中', 86), ('見', 85), ('花', 85), ('時', 84), ('3', 83), ('下', 79), ('青', 79), ('歸', 78), ('如', 78), ('白', 77), ('秋', 74), ('明', 72), ('萬', 72), ('三', 71), ('落', 71), ('為', 70), ('自', 67), ('空', 67), ('此', 64), ('雨', 63), ('金', 62), ('4', 62), ('5', 62), ('6', 62), ('7', 62), ('8', 62), ('9', 62), ('去', 62), ('今', 61), ('南', 59), ('城', 59), ('欲', 59), ('家', 58), ('將', 58), ('馬', 58), ('古', 58), ('年', 58), ('未', 57), ('門', 57), ('西', 57), ('在', 56), ('心', 56), ('清', 56), ('飛', 56), ('寒', 56), ('子', 56), ('聲', 56), ('客', 55), ('事', 54), ('處', 54), ('別', 54), ('朝', 54), ('陽', 53), ('黃', 52), ('高', 51), ('大', 51), ('入', 50), ('與', 50), ('玉', 50), ('出', 50), ('道', 50), ('望', 49), ('十', 49), ('流', 49), ('二', 48), ('歌', 48), ('送', 48), ('宮', 48), ('得', 47)]\n\nJust the characters\n\n，. 。. 不. 人. 山. 1. 0. 2. ？. 一. 無. 月. 日. ；. 夜. 天. 風. 來. 雲. 上. 長. 有. 江. 春. 相. 何. 行. 生. 君. 之. 水. 中. 見. 花. 時. 3. 下. 青. 歸. 如. 白. 秋. 明. 萬. 三. 落. 為. 自. 空. 此. 雨. 金. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 去. 今. 南. 城. 欲. 家. 將. 馬. 古. 年. 未. 門. 西. 在. 心. 清. 飛. 寒. 子. 聲. 客. 事. 處. 別. 朝. 陽. 黃. 高. 大. 入. 與. 玉. 出. 道. 望. 十. 流. 二. 歌. 送. 宮. 得.\n\nPassing through Google Translate, removing punctuation and arabic numerals:\n\nNo. People.

We first found this theme prevalent in poetry from the Six Dynasties Period, and it isn't surprising that it continues to show in this dynasty. This also matches the writing we analyzed in class, like the nature descriptions Du Fu uses in poems like *A Song on How My Thatched Roof Was Ruined by the Autumn Wind*. It's also interesting that the word Mountain is the third highest word in the frequency list, and I'm still unsure why.\n\nAnother prominent theme is the passage of time, seen through words like Month, Year, Ancient, Today, Sun, Night, Autumn, Long, Time. We didn't see this theme appear in the poetry we read in class. Another thing that surprises me is that there are no words related to alcohol or drinking, because it was a common theme in Li Bai's work. The Dao is also mentioned more often than I expected, showing up 50 times. We discussed Daoism in class, and it was interesting to see it show up in these poems. I wondered if the Dao was being mentioned throughout the data or if there were one or two poets thatfocused on Daoism. I looked through the data for mentions of \"道\" and they were relatively spread out. The poems are organized by author for the most part, meaning that the data must be from more than just a few of the poets.\n\nThere are also words like Travel, City, Gold, Jade, and Palace, which reflect the fact that many of the people who wrote poems were wealthy or came from rich households. Poetry was a very respected form of writing, and almost all poets were educated and literate with many of them serving in the government.\n\nOverall, the most frequent words typically matched what I expected, and gave further insight into the poetry of the Tang Dynasty. If I could continue this analysis, I would want to add more poems to my data set and dive further into the use of specific words like Dao. I could also improve the accuracy of this analysis with the help of a Chinese speaker and a deeper understanding of Chinese history.\n\n##### Sources\n_唐诗三百首 by Hengtangtuishi_. (2016, June 13).

The first idea is continuing reflection 1, where I looked at the Will Wight's book series *Cradle*, its influences, and the meaning of its popularity. The series has heavy Daoist influences and throughout the readings for class I've found parallels to Cradle's story. The series is also based on the Chinese genre of xianxia, with the author in an interview saying he wanted to bring this genre of stories to a Western audience. This idea has been a success, and the series' last few installments have reached number one on Amazon's book list and number one in the New York Times bestselling audiobook list during their release. Cradle is categorized as progression fantasy, and I believe we will see stories like it become more popular in the future. While I've read other progression fantasy stories, I've read little xianxia, and for the final project would like to read a couple of these books, compare them to both Cradle and the readings from class, and see if I can chart out the influence of Chinese literature through this chain of works. I want to clearly define xianxia, wuxia, and cultivation,\n\nI want to understand the differences between xianxia, wuxia, and cultivation, show their influences (especially how they were influenced by the works we've discussed in class), show their histories as genres, where they are today, and where I think they will go in the future: to broader, global audiences. \n\nThe project will be split into two parts. One part will be a deep dive into the history of Chinese fantasy, tracing back xianxia and wuxia's influences and histories. The second part will be reading some of these works and comparing them.\n\nThere is a line that can be drawn from *Cradle* all the way back to [[Records of the Grand Historian]] and with this project I'd like to trace what we've learned in class to works being written today.\n\nThis is relevant to the class because these works I consider literature.

I analyzed its Daoist influences and its parallels to Chinese works that we've discussed in class. There was a lot more I wanted to articulate in that reflection, primarily how the series serves as a Western take on Chinese fantasy and why that's important.\n\nI first discovered the Cradle series two years ago, and I was inspired to look for more works like it. In an interview I found, the author talked about how Cradle was an attempt to \"westernize\" xianxia stories. I ended up looking into xianxia, cultivation, litrpg, and wuxia stories after reading Cradle, and I believe Cradle served as an entry point into these fantasy genres for many other readers as well. The last book released was the fourth in a row to reach #1 in the Amazon Kindle Store, and the Kickstarter to reprint the first three books stands as the fourth-highest-funded fiction Kickstarter on the website. This success, its direct inspiration from Chinese fantasy, and the large online communities dedicated to recommending books like Cradle are why I believe many readers like myself are being introduced to Chinese fantasy through the series. For this project, I want to start by talking about present-day fantasy series like Cradle and why their Chinese fantasy influences make not only them more successful, but also the works they were inspired by through people looking further into the genre. \n\nWhile looking into Cradle for the first reflection, I learned more about xianxia, wuxia, and their histories as fantasy subgenres. Diving further into the history of these genres, I found mentions of a lot of the texts we discussed in class, like [[A Burial Mound for Flowers|The Water Margin]], [[Journey to the West]], and more. There is a line that can be drawn from *Cradle* all the way back to [[Records of the Grand Historian]] and with this project I'd like to trace the works we've discussed in class to fantasy works being written today.\n\nBesides researching the history of the genres, I will also select different texts to analyze in order to see how Chinese fantasy has changed with these genres. One book I would like to look at is Jin Yong's [[Legend of the Condor Heroes]]. This book was written in 1957 and has been highly influential since its publication. Besides serving as a look into the past, the work also tells us about the spread of the wuxia genre today. An English translation of the story was published across four volumes from 2018 to 2021, showing the influence of Jin Yong's writing and reinforcing that these stories have become popular very recently among Western audiences. The work is extremely long, and I'm sure I won't be able to read all of it, but just reading a portion would still be insightful.\n\nI would also like to look at some cultivation novels. Cultivation is a subgenre of xianxia and focuses on Daoist ideas of cultivation. This genre seems to have been popularized fue to the growth of online works and web novels published on websites like Royal Road. I have read bits and pieces of these works before, but would like to explore them on a deeper level. I believe E-novels may be the frontier for Chinese fantasy today in terms of their spread to Western audiences, and I'd like to find if these works share themes or influences with Cradle. I will likely find other works to add to the project as well as I continue my research.\n\nThe project would be composed of either a writeup accompanied by a timeline or a website accompanied by a timeline. I would like to use Obsidian and its extension Quartz https://quartz.jzhao.xyz to create a website with pages linked together that takes the reader through the same content as a writeup would, but with more interactivity and organization. I want to use this project as an opportunity to try out this format and see what I can do with it. Using these tools, I should be able to make a timeline like the one shown below, with each entry pointing to the related page on the site, as an alternate way to interface with the project.\n\n![[Pasted image 20221120235736.png]]\n*Example timeline*\n\nThe final product would be a website detailing the history and evolution of Chinese fantasy, analysis of specific fantasy works, and the increased interest in Chinese fantasy works today. I will discuss the works we read in class through their role in the history of the genre and their connections to the specific books I read for the project. I may also include a section on why these fantasy works should be considered literature and what makes fantasy an important genre to discuss. I will also organize the website with an interactive timeline view.\n\n\nok done real final draft is below\n\n![[CHIN309 Reflection 3.pdf]]","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.424918391Z","tags":null},"/Assignments/Fall-2022-Assignments/CHIN309-Reflection-3-Scratch":{"title":"","content":"tags: #assignment \ncreation date: [[2022-11-07 Monday]] 20:06:44\ndescription::\n\ntopic\n-  final project proposal\n\t- ideas for final project\n\t\t- 1. continue first reflection topic\n\t\t\t- exploring connections to xianxia and wuxia\n\t\t\t- xianxia and wuxia as literature\n\t\t\t- xianxia and wuxia growing influence in western fantasy\n\t\t- 2. continue second reflection topic\n\t\t\t- distant reading analysis of chinese literature\n\t\t\t- can compare dynasties or something\n\t\t\t- idk really what to do with this\n\ndescription\n\u003e [!Assignment]\n\u003e Please submit a reflection based on material we have covered through October 25th!

The book is made up of the letters Bird sent to her sister throughout her trip. Bird enters the country in Yokohama, one of the first ports Japan opened to global trade, and from there travels to Tokyo. She prepares for her trip with the help of her European acquaintances living in Tokyo, and travels on foot, horseback, and boat throughout the country, ending in Hokkaido.\n\nWhile Bird's book serves to document her travels, it can be looked at today through the lens of Japan's rapid development during the Meiji era caused by pressure from Western forces. Mary Louise Pratt in the book *Imperial Eyes* examines similar Western forces of imperialism in the Americas and Africa. We can apply the concepts Pratt uses in *Imperial Eyes* to Bird's journey in *Unbeaten Tracks* to analyze how her travels contributed to Western imperialist efforts in Japan.\n\nBird's journey through Japan's interior was not only the first time many indigenous Japanese people encountered European culture, but also the first time many Europeans read about Japanese culture. In this way, Bird serves as a \"traveling contact zone.\"\n\nAs Pratt describes it, a contact zone is an area where cultures encounter, especially in an imperialist setting, where one culture has power over a smaller, indigenous culture. In Bird's case, the contact is between European and Japanese cultures. When Pratt refers to contact zones, it's typically about a location where groups from the two cultures meet, but here it is one woman moving from village to village, hence traveling contact zone. For many of the people she meets, this is one of the first times they've met a European and been exposed to their culture. This also goes the other way, as Bird's writings circulated in Europe, serving as many readers' first interaction with Japanese cultures. Bird's writings even circulated among cities in Japan, as travel was difficult, and many Japanese people living in urban areas never had the chance to interact with those living in rural areas.\n\nBird is also able to give a firsthand account of contact zones closer to Pratt's definition. Yokohama and Tokyo both serve as contact zones between Western and Japanese cultures, as they were areas integral to international trade. On her train ride from Yokohama to Edo, Bird describes how the rail was built by American engineers and how the Japanese officials riding with her wore European dress (Bird, 13-14). Another contact zone is between the Aino people and the Japanese government. Bird visits the Ainos, the indigenous people of Hokkaido, and describes how they have recently been struggling with the Japanese government's prohibitions on tattoos and arrow traps (Bird, 159, 165).\n\nIn her letters, Bird writes about the hardships she faced, mostly complaining about the quality of living in the villages she stays the night in. As the journey goes on, the reader gets an understanding of Bird's feelings towards Japan. She looks down on the people she meets and finds their living inferior, but revels in the opportunity to study them like a newly discovered species. In one encounter, as a crowd gathers around to see the foreigner that rode into town, she remarks, \n\n\"When I went out I found fully 1000 people helping me realize how the crowded cities of Judea sent forth people clothed much as these are when the Miracle-Worker from Galilee arrived, but not what the fatigue of the crowding and buzzing must have been to One who had been preaching and working during the long day\" (Bird, 66).\n\nWhile she goes back and forth throughout the text between indifference and derision, this quote where Bird likens herself to Jesus Christ shows the height of her ego. She portrays herself as an innocent traveler in a strange land but still sees herself as the most distinguished individual in the village. Bird here fits Pratt's idea of a \"protagonist of the anti-conquest\" (Pratt, 7).\n\nThe anti-conquest is an idea, or even a state of mind, where the colonizing party seeks to claim their actions innocent while continuing to assert their power. Bird is only traveling through Japan, not actively colonizing it, but she still is a part of the Western force pressuring Japan. She claims to just be a tourist, but actively airs her grievances with the current state of the country and looks down upon its people.\n\nThe third, final concept Pratt describes is autoethnography, or autoethnographic expression. Pratt describes autoethnographic expression as instances where the colonized take on the colonizer's culture, especially in an attempt to fight or otherwise engage the colonizer on the colonizer's terms. This is the most explicitly political of the three concepts, and as such, Bird's letters don't offer many instances because she avoids politics for most of the text. The Japanese officials' adoption of Western clothing may have been done to be taken more seriously by Western officials (Bird, 14). We also see during Bird's search for an interpreter that many Japanese people were learning English to find work opportunities (Bird, 17). While these people were not necessarily learning English to fight against Western forces, this does show the growing need for interpreters in Japan.\n\n Bird's travels, whether she knew it at the time or not, would pave the way for other foreign travelers in Japan, contributing to the country's rapid globalization. By analyzing her journey using Pratt's concepts of imperialism, it is clear that Bird contributed to the Western forces that pressured Japan into opening international trade and accepting Western cultures. Bird was one of the first foreigners to make the journey through the interior, and her writings brought many more travelers to Japan after her.","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.424918391Z","tags":null},"/Assignments/Fall-2022-Assignments/JAPN208-Essay-1-planning":{"title":"","content":"tags: #assignment \ncreation date: [[2022-09-23 Friday]] 21:39:49\nmodification date: [[2022-09-23 Friday]] 21:39:49\n\n## Essay 1 planning\n##### prompt\nWrite an 800 word paper on Isabella Bird’s Unbeaten Tracks in Japan in relation to the analytical concepts that Pratt introduces in her Imperial Eyes, such as “contact zone.” First, explain these concepts, and then, discuss how these concepts can be applied to the analysis of Bird’s observations of Japan.

Getting the Data\nBriefly describe your data, the format it is in, and list your data sources. For example, you may be obtaining data from websites – list the specific websites and describe whether you are able to download text files, you are creating text files, you are using OCR, etc. Will you need to collect your data via a survey? How will you do that?\n\nWe are using Spotify's Top 50 playlists; these show the most popular songs in a country (ranked by Spotify's algorithm). We use Spotify data because the platform collects a lot of metadata - for each song, they collect basic information like the artist and the genre, but also more specific data that helps their algorithm find related songs. This specific data includes information like subgenres, tempo, key, time signature, decibel volume, and even ratings for more abstract concepts, like how 'happy' or 'danceable' a song is.\n\nTo extract this data from Spotify, we are using Chosic's playlist analyzer. This website is meant to help Spotify users make better playlists, but we can also use it to convert playlists into CSV files containing each song and its metadata.\n\nWe are collecting CSV files for 11 different Spotify playlists, and since these playlists are automatically updated every day, we plan to collect data at least five times a week in order to analyze not only how the data changes between countries, but also how each country changes over time\n\n### II. Data Pre-processing\nWhat pre-processing will you have to do of your data? Will you need to convert your data to another format (e.g. from pdf to text, or from html to text)? For text data, will you be removing punctuation and/or stopwords? Will you have a custom set of stopwords? Will you be removing any data prior to your analysis? Will you be searching for specific terms?\n\nChosic does a good job of formatting the CSV files, so we don't need to do anything to the contents of each file. However, because we are collecting many files of data, we want to name each file in a way that makes it easy to go through all of them in code. We have decided to use the format \"041022 Ukraine\"; the date of which the data was collected, and the country it is from. We can easily process files from a specific date or specific country this way. Because we are using titles, authors, genres, etc., we do not need to take stopwords into account.\n\n### III. Data Analysis\nDescribe the data analysis you will do. Be specific as to computational tools you will use – it is not enough just to say Python. This is the place to figure out if you need to learn about/access additional tools. If you don’t know what tool you need, describe the type of analysis you need to do and we will help you to find the tool.\n\nIn order to extract data from the csv files, we are using the pandas python library. Then, we can use the nltk and wordclouds libraries in order to create graphics and analyze the data we receive. As of right now, our analysis is exploratory. Once we collect an ample amount of data, we will look at what trends emerge and figure out ways to analyze them.\n\n\n### IV. Presentation of Results and Conclusions\nUltimately you will need to prepare slides for a presentation. What will be on those slides? What sorts of visualizations will you need to display your results? Make sure your visualizations are appropriate for the kind of data you will present. Will you prepare a web page or a handout in addition to your presentation?\n\nFor our slides, the team plans to demonstrate the progression of the Top 50 playlists over the last few weeks. We will have slides to break down consecutive days, noting and visualizing the major changes in the rankings, as well as comparing and contrasting the countries we collect data for. We will use word clouds, frequency distributions, and other graphs in order to show our findings visually. We can analyze genre frequency, artist frequency, changes over time, geographic differences, and more. In our website, our data will be presented and organized among different tabs, so that viewers may navigate our findings.","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.424918391Z","tags":null},"/Assignments/Spring-2022-Assignments/CS100-Text-Analysis-Assignment-Final-Draft":{"title":"","content":"# CS100 Text Analysis\nFor this assignment, I analyzed 6 of Dostoevsky's works, centered chronologically around Crime and Punishment. I looked at:\n- The House of the Dead (1862)\n- Notes from the Underground (1864)\n- Crime and Punishment (1866)\n- The Idiot (1869)\n- Demons (1872)\n- The Brothers Karamazov (1880)\n\nMy goal was to see if concepts and motifs explored in Crime and Punishment were seen in Dostoevsky's works leading up to it and if these concepts permeated his later works. Many consider Crime and Punishment to be Dostoevsky's magnum opus, and I believe we will see its influence throughout his other works because of how strong of an impact it had.\n\nI started by downloading text files of the six books and formatting them for analysis. I removed the extraneous information at the beginning and end of each book, but left the word \"ENDMARKER\" at the ends, as it would be useful later for the dispersion plots. In the python script, I took these text files and combined them into one string, keeping the texts in chronological order of when they were released.\n\n### Word Clouds\nI used word clouds in order to get a feel for the data and find any trends that were emerging. First, I made a word cloud with all six texts using the default stopwords list.\n![[Pasted image 20220410201133.png]]\nI kept creating clouds, and with each iteration, I added some of my own stopwords to the list, and finally, I removed Crime and Punishment in order to find what words were most common in the five books that I wasn't familiar with.\n![[Pasted image 20220410202221.png]]\nFrom this word cloud, I could start to see what kinds of themes showed up in Dostoevsky's works.\n- I am not surprised that 'time' is common, because throughout Crime and Punishment, the time was important to Raskolnikov and the events of the novel all happened within a timeline of a few weeks.\n- 'See' might count as a stopword, but it could show how Dostoevsky finds importance in how characters perceive the world around them, and how perceptions and ideologies differ.\n- I think that it's strange that 'prince' is the biggest word, but it must be used as an honorific. This surprised me because there is little reference to royalty in Crime and Punishment.\n\n### Dispersion Plots\nNext, I split the texts up into tokens. This actually took a long time; I had to wait about ten minutes each time I ran this command. But once I had the text in a tokenized form, I could create text dispersion plots and analyze collocations and concordances.\n![[Pasted image 20220410211640.png]]\nI wanted to see how themes from Crime and Punishment showed up in the other texts, so I used a dispersion plot to find this. This graph shows all six novels in one timeline. In order to discern where one text ends and the other begins, I left the word 'ENDMARKER' at the end of each book. By tracking the word 'ENDMARKER' in the dispersion plot, we can conveniently split the graph into the six books. Crime and Punishment is the third section, roughly between the 100,000 and 200,000 word markers.\n\nI picked the keywords for the first dispersion plot based on the ones that I thought would be interesting, and based the keywords in the second plot on words I found online in summaries of Crime and Punishment.\n![[Pasted image 20220410213642.png]]\nI had a few interesting takeaways from these graphs:\n\nSimilarities\n- The word 'heard' is used very often throughout Dostoevsky's works. I wanted to use this word because the idea of eavesdropping and listening to things you weren't supposed to is Dostoevsky's favorite form of coincidence in Crime and Punishment, and this data shows that listening is important in all of his works.\n- 'Money' and 'God' are also common themes throughout Dostoevsky's work, just like in Crime and Punishment.\n- St. 'Petersburg' shows up often in Dostoevsky's work as well.\n\nDifferences\n- The words 'crime' and 'punishment' were not used most often in the actual book Crime and Punishment, but in the stories that came before it. After Crime and Punishment, we can see that they stop showing up as often.\n- After Crime and Punishment, the word 'confession' becomes used more often, and 'repent' follows the same trend, but is still used rarely. I believe if I had tracked different versions of these words, like 'repentance' or 'confessing', I could find a more concise answer as to how the idea of repentance was used throughout Dostoevsky's works.\n- The word 'illness' is used most often in Crime and Punishment, showing how dramatic Raskolnikov is!\n\n### Collocations and Concordances\nFinally, I looked at the top collocations, as well as some concordances for words I was interested in.\n```\ncollocations:\nStepan Trofimovitch; Pyotr Stepanovitch; Varvara Petrovna; Katerina\nIvanovna; Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch; Fyodor Pavlovitch; Nastasia\nPhilipovna; Yulia Mihailovna; every one; Lizabetha Prokofievna;\nMavriky Nikolaevitch; old man; Avdotya Romanovna; Evgenie Pavlovitch;\nDmitri Fyodorovitch; Pulcheria Alexandrovna; Pyotr Petrovitch; young\nman; great deal; three thousand; old woman; Mrs. Epanchin; thousand\nroubles; Rodion Romanovitch; Nikolay Parfenovitch; Madame Hohlakov;\nAndrey Antonovitch; hundred roubles; Alexey Fyodorovitch; Father\nZossima; Lizaveta Nikolaevna; convict prison; Sofya Semyonovna; Pyotr\nIlyitch; Marya Timofyevna; Gavrila Ardalionovitch; Father Païssy; next\nday; Porfiry Petrovitch; long time; one another; Nina Alexandrovna;\nMarfa Petrovna; three days; long ago; Darya Pavlovna; hard labour;\nSofya Matveyevna; Ippolit Kirillovitch; several times\n```\nNames removed:\n```\ncollocations:\nevery one; old man; young man; great deal; three thousand; old woman;\nthousand roubles; hundred roubles; convict prison; next day; long time;\none another; three days; long ago; hard labour; several times\n```\nThere are a few patterns to these collocations: money, time, and punishment. Phrases like 'great deal' and 'thousand rubles' show money's importance, phrases like 'three days,' 'long ago,' and 'next day' show time's importance, and phrases like 'convict prison' and 'hard labour' show punishment. I was not expecting the punishment-related phrases to show up as often as they did.\n\nFinally, I looked at concordances. I chose 'Lazarus' because I have found that the story is referenced in a lot of literary work, and wanted to see if Dostoevsky used it again. I also chose 'split' and 'louse' because they showed up a lot less in the dispersion plots than I thought they would, and wanted to see specifically where they were used.\n```\nDisplaying 10 of 10 matches:\nPorfiry “ And ... do you believe in Lazarus ’ rising from the dead ” “ I ...

Discuss Nikolai Gogol’s novella “The Nose” as an example of a “Petersburg tale.” What is the role of setting in “The Nose”? How does the setting contribute to the phantastic and absurdist aspects of the tale? Provide 2 specific examples. How does the narrative voice create ambiguity about the events and the characters?\n\nB. Discuss folktales as a type of pre-modern narratives. How were folktales created and circulated? Who and when collected and published Russian folktales? What three _types_ of folktales did we discuss in class? List at least 3 stylistic features typical of folktales and provide examples from the Russian tales we read in the course.\n\nFolktales are old stories that were passed down orally. These stories are often fantastical, follow similar structures, and were made to entertain or pass down lessons to the next generation. Because they were passed down orally, the full history of folktales are unknown, but a collection of Russian folktales was compiled and published in the 1800s by Alexander Afanasyev.\n\nThere are three major types of folktales: animal tales, wonder tales, and tales of everyday life. These folktales often involve a blending of reality and magical elements to tell a story. Because folktales evolved from other folktales over time, there are stylistic features that are common in a folktale. The magic number 3 is seen in stories like the The Frog Princess, where three wives, each married to one of the king's three sons, compete with each other in three different skills. The magic number three is also seen in Baba Yaga and the Brave Youth, where Baba Yaga has three daughters, and Vasilisa the Beautiful, where Vasilisa encounters three horsemen. These horsemen represent another stylistic feature of folktales: anthropomorphism. The horsemen represent the personification of day, the rising sun, and night. Other stories feature talking animals, like in The Goldfish, or inanimate objects brought to life, like Baba Yaga's house on chicken legs. A final example of a stylistic feature are fixed epithets. These are signature archetypes, like Holy Russia, brave youth, fair maiden, and wicked stepmother, that are used across many stories. These features help to identify folktales, and show how folktales evolved as a form of literature.\n\nFolktales were created and circulated orally by storytellers\nPassed down orally\nFolktales are told to children\nFolktales follow similar tropes\nCollected by Afanasyev\nThree types\n- Animal tale\n- Everyday life\n- Wonder tale\nStylistic features\n- Magic numbers\n- Fixed epithets\n- Fixed locations\n- Fixed situations\n- Metamorphosis\n- Anthropromorphism\n- Formulaic style\nExamples of stylistic features\n- Magic numbers\n\t- Three sons, Three fair maidens, Repitition in threes, three tests\n\t- [[The Frog Princess]] three sons want three brides have three trials\n\t- [[Vasilisa the Beautiful]] baba yaga summons a set of three hands\n\t- [[Baba Yaga and the Brave Youth]] baba yaga has three daughters\n\t- [[The Goldfish]] at the end, refuses to show up after 3 calls\n- Anthropromorphism\n\t- White red black horsemen\n\t- [[Vasilisa the Beautiful]]\n- Fixed situations\n\t- Being tested by Baba Yaga\n\t- [[The Frog Princess]]\n\t- [[Baba Yaga and the Brave Youth]]\n\t- [[Vasilisa the Beautiful]]\n\n[[The Morphology of the Folktale by Vladimir Propp]]\n\nC. Discuss the _Primary Chronicle_ as a type of medieval writing. Who composed it and when? How is it different from modern historical accounts (consider, e.g., the first entry)? Briefly discuss “The Martyrdom of Boris and Gleb” and why they were canonized as saints.\n\nD. Raskol’nikov’s last name in _Crime and Punishment_ means split/schism. What is his “split”? What are the two sides of his personality? What other characters embody one or the other side of this split? Provide specific examples.\n\nSplit\n- uses an axe to split\n- split between man and louse\n- split between right and wrong\n- split between wanting to confess and scared of punishment\n\nEmbodied by\n- Svidrigailov\n\t- represents not confessing\n\t- finding how to stop caring\n\t- crime\n- Porfiry, Sonia\n\t- confession\n\t- punishment\n\nRaskolnikov's name meaning schism/split is very symbolic of his character. Throughout the book, he thinks one way and then acts another, or is torn between choices. We can see his split personality in many scenes, such as the scene on the bridge in part 1, where he helps a drunk girl by alerting an officer for help, and then turns and tells the officer to leave her on the street anyway. This scene shows how Raskolnikov is torn between his own instincts for compassion and his anger towards the world.\n\nIn Raskolnikov's essay, he writes about how extraordinary men are able to forego punishment for their crimes when they commit these crimes for the greater good. He highlights the split between man and louse, and when he commits his own crime, tries to prove that he is not the louse.\n\nAfter Raskolnikov commits his crime, he is faced with another split: the choice to confess or not to confess. These choices are personified in the characters Svidrigailov and Porfiry Petrovich. In the later acts of the book, the two characters' conversations with Raskolnikov help him make his decision. Svidrigailov has committed many crimes and gotten away with them thanks to his wealth. He is at peace with his crimes, and is able to live beyond morality. Porfiry, the man investigating Raskolnikov's murder case, knows that Raskolnikov committed the crime and tells him to confess in order to recieve a lighter sentence and start on the path towards redemption. Raskolnikov battles with the idea of confession, fearing what his punishment will be.\n\nThese actions, ideas, and decisions that Raskolnikov wrestles with show how the meaning of his name fits his character. There are other ways in which this concept is used, such as the very literal use of a \"splitting\" axe as his murder weapon. Splitting becomes a motif used throughout the book to represent Raskolnikov's moral and spiritual struggles.\n\n\n\n\n\nE. What is “distant reading”? How do its methods differ from those of the close human(istic) reading? What do the two types of reading have in common? How does Franco Moretti use the methods of distant reading in his chapter “Graphs” that we read in this course? What are his specific findings? Provide at least 2 examples.\n\n\n\n\n---\n### Flashcards\n- \n\n\n### Related Topics\n- \n\n\n\n### Intangibles (to be rewritten)\n-","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.424918391Z","tags":null},"/Assignments/Spring-2022-Assignments/Folk-vs.-Literary-Tales-Short-Response":{"title":"","content":"Tags: #flashcards #assignment #CSCI100\n\n# Folk vs. Literary Tales Short Response\n\n### Prompt\nHow are descriptions of characters and settings in folk tales different from those in a literary tale? To what effect? Consider detail; (external) action vs. inner world (motivation, thoughts, etc); use of figures of speech (metaphors, similes/comparisons). Provide 2 examples from Gogol and folk tales.\n\n### Response\nIn folk tales, the story rarely, if ever, uses a first-person perspective. Folk tales were passed down orally, and because of this they are told from the perspective of a narrator. Many literary tales use narrators as well, but first-person perspectives are also used by literary tales to gain insight into a character's thoughts.\n\nThis difference in perspective highlights the biggest difference between folk tales and literary tales: folk tales are about actions, and literary tales are about characters. This isn't always the case, but literary tales tend to focus more on fleshing out characters than folk tales do. Folk tales will sacrifice having interesting characters in order to have the characters take interesting actions.\n\nThis is because folk tales aren't meant to create interesting characters; they are meant to impress a lesson on to those who listen to them. We aren't meant to sympathize with the daughters that are sent to Baba Yaga; we're supposed to learn to obey our elders. We aren't meant to explore Vasilisa's character; we are meant to pray to God when we need help. The usage of names like Vasilisa or Ivan reinforce the idea that the characters are stand-ins used so that the listener can picture themselves in the story. In a folktale, the reader should come away remembering a lesson. In literary tales, the reader comes away remembering characters.","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.424918391Z","tags":null},"/Assignments/Spring-2022-Assignments/Folktales-Website-Short-Response":{"title":"","content":"Tags: #flashcards #assignment #CSCI100\nCreated: Monday, Feb 14\n\n# Folktales Website Short Response\n\n### Prompt\nWrite a short response to the web site, ([http://ft.obdurodon.org)](http://ft.obdurodon.org/) discussing the site’s “readability”: 1. its utility as a tool for exploring the subject, 2.

By using XML to find speech verbs in Afanasyev's collection of Russian tales, the people behind the website are able to find how actions and speech differ between genders in these tales. \n\nThere are some issues with the readability of the project. One is that most of the studied text, like the verbs they collected, are left in their original Russian, with no translation to go along with them in the data visualizations. It makes sense that the data should be collected from the original Russian texts and not a translation, however it would be helpful to the reader if the graphs and tables were translated after data collection. A reader could use a translation tool, but these tools are unable to convey the nuance of certain speech verbs. This would be like translating \"instructed,\" \"reprimanded,\" and \"coached\" all into \"said\" or \"taught.\" This nuance is also critical when analyzing how frequently these speech verbs are used for different genders.\n\nThe data they found could also be used in more interesting ways. They collected information on how frequently each character's name was said in each story, but they didn't use this data in their final visualizations. With the data from this study, others could do research into how frequently certain epithets are used, how frequently certain recurring characters are used, or how a recurring character's role differs depending on the \"type\" of story.\n\nDespite these gaps, the study is able to effectively delve into its topic and come to the conclusions it was looking for. The study's methods of data collection are novel (to our class, at least), and could be used in future distant reading projects.\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.424918391Z","tags":null},"/Assignments/Spring-2022-Assignments/LING220-Midterm":{"title":"","content":"Tags: #flashcards #notes #LING220\nCreated: Monday, Mar 21\n[[International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)]]\n\n# Midterm\n### Notes\nDuring class, 50 minutes\nOpen notes, only class notes\nWill have IPA to refer to\nOn Friday\n\nTranscription:\n- individual English words\n- one word at a time\n- watch handwriting\n- words played out loud multiple times for the whole class to hear\n\nAllomorphs\n- [[Morphology II#Allomorphs]]\n- more than one way to articulate the same morpheme\n- if asked for all the allomorphs, might just be one, or could be multiple\n- cats \"cat\" and \"s\" allomorphs\n\nAllophones\n- [[Phonology II - Phonemes#Allophones]]\n- More than one way to say something\n- underlyingly the same phoneme\n- $[t]$ and flap represent $/t/$\n- allo means more than one pronunciation of a thing\n- remember \"all\"\n- [[Morphology II#allophone vs allomorph]]\n- phones or \"sounds\" within a morph\n- \"phones are at the sound level in phonology, morphs are at the word level in morphology\"\n\nAssimilation\n- [[Morphology II#Assimilation]]\n- there are multiple allomorphs for one phoneme because of pronunciation\n- look at conditioning environment\n\t- the sounds are influenced by the surrounding sounds, become more similar to surrounding sounds\n- \"when a sound becomes more like a nearby sound in some phonetic way\"\n- ex. cupboard\n- ex. moved vs left\n\nInflectional / Derivational\n- [[Morphology I#Inflectional and Derivational Affixes]]\n- inflectional - tweaking the meaning of the word, core meaning stays the same\n\t- ex. cats\n\t- [[Morphology I#common types of inflectional affixes]]\n\t- plurals, possessives, tense, gender, comparative/superlative, honorific\n- derivational - give new words with their own meanings\n\t- ex. review, dislike\n\t- a review is not \"to view again\" its a critique/response/opinion which is kind of viewing something again but it changes the core meaning of the word view i guess\n- inflectional is making a small change to a word to give it context\n- conceptually derivational has to do with making new words in a language like television putting morphs together\n- is cat vs cats different words?

Search engines, text to speech, voice recognition, and spellcheck are all technologies that need to process human input and understand how people use language, and they use the structures and patterns we've studied in class in order to do this successfully. However, these technologies still have issues, and there is work that needs to be done to perfect language processing. \n\nAnother area where the study of language applies is in creating programming languages themselves. All languages have their own syntax and rules in order to interface with a computer, and this needs to be taken into account in order to make a language accessible. However, making a programming language easier to read and understand can cause the commands to lose some of their nuance, and performance can worsen because of this. For example, Python is easier to read and write than Java, but Python is slower than Java. There's a balance act between making a language understandable to humans and understandable to machines, and linguistic principles are used in making the decisions of how to structure a programming language.","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.424918391Z","tags":null},"/Assignments/Spring-2022-Assignments/LING220-Variation-Final-Project":{"title":"","content":"Tags: #notes #LING220\nCreated: Wednesday, Apr 27\n[[International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)]]\n\n# LING220 Variation Final Project\n##### ideas\nRussian English? could be easy since I already have a Russian class but idk if thats actually a thing\nFilipino dialects? idk anything about Tagalog\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n### Related Pages\n- [[Swem Research Guide]]\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.424918391Z","tags":null},"/Assignments/Spring-2022-Assignments/Linguistic-Autobiography":{"title":"","content":"##### Brainstorm\n\nIdeas of things that influenced my language\n- Mom\n\t- Filipino\n\t- Taglish\n\t- I know a few Filipino words but not much\n\t- Mom did an edition of Rosetta Stone Filipino\n- Dad\n\t- English\n\t- I can only speak English\n- Internet\n\t- Online culture and slang\n- School\n\t- English class\n\t- DE English I really enjoyed\n\t- Frankenstein\n\t- I enjoyed writing literary analyses\n- Podcasts\n\t- Dissect\n\t\t- DAMN analysis\n- Youtube\n\t- Listening to people on Youtube from a young age\n\t- Watching science Youtubers\n\nWhy I took linguistics\n- CS\n\t- Natural language processing\n\t- Recommended to do a linguistics class in CS120\n- Jan Misali\n\t- Linguistics Youtuber\n\t- Found his videos intriguing but confusing\n\t- Sparked an interest in how language works","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.424918391Z","tags":null},"/Assignments/Spring-2022-Assignments/Phonetics-Assignment":{"title":"","content":"Tags: #flashcards #assignment #LING220 \nCreated: Sunday, Feb 13\n\n# Phonetics Assignment\n\n### Prompt\nPart 1: International Phonetics Alphabet • Make yourself physical or online fashcards for the American English consonants and vowels.

Examples of contributions could include making your own study aides, doing additional outside reading, coming to offce hours … joining a study group, asking and answering questions in class, doing problems on the board … emailing me a linguistics blog, cartoon, or article … and so on. Create a refection on your contribution to the class, covering these questions: \n\n• What are the specifc instances in which you have contributed to learning? \n• What ways of learning linguistics have been most helpful for you? \n• How do you plan to participate in learning linguistics during the rest of the semester? \n\nYou may use any format, including creative ones. Responses in essay format should be about 250-350 words; audio 'podcasts' should be 1 – 2 minutes max. Your refection will be assessed for thoughtfulness and thoroughness; your overall class contribution will be assessed separately at the end of the semester.\n\n##### Ideas\nways i contribute\n- notes\n\t- ive been taking pretty notes\n\t- organized like a wiki\n\t- i spend time outside of class to make them useful\n\t- i create flashcards out of my notes (lie)\n\t- i could just talk about obsidian if i need more words\n\t- my notes are easy to share\n\t- i can search through my notes\n\t- ill have access to my notes in the future\n\t- working on website\n\t- https://carlomehegan.github.io/my-notes/\n\t- website doesnt work but i want to have all my notes here by the end of the year\n- getting to class\n\t- im still late sometimes but ive been doing better as the semester goes on\n- in class\n\t- i stay engaged and keep notes\n\n• What are the specifc instances in which you have contributed to learning? \nsharing notes\n• What ways of learning linguistics have been most helpful for you? \n\n• How do you plan to participate in learning linguistics during the rest of the semester? \n\n\n#####  Response\nMy class contribution is mostly in how I take my notes. For the last few months, I've been trying to find systems that let me keep notes virtually. I'm currently using Obsidian to accomplish this. My goal is to be able to find items in my notes quickly and be able to share my notes online. Obsidian is helping me towards those goals, and it is what I have been using to write all of my notes for this class.\n\nStructurally, I have been following the paper handout templates for our notes, but keeping them virtual makes it easier for me to link information together and find what I need. I also use virtual flashcards in Obsidian in order to memorize vocabulary.\n\nObsidian formats notes using Markdown, which is a markup language like HTML. This means I can easily convert the files to PDF for sharing, which is what I did for the first note-sharing assignment. My main goal is to be able to upload my notes to my own webpage, so I can link people to them. I'm working on making this site now and wanted to have it ready for this reflection, but it's [still under construction](https://carlomehegan.github.io/my-notes/).\n\nImplementing this note system takes some extra effort, but I believe that it will be worth it to have everything I learn in a searchable, sharable format. This is especially useful for this class since we practice note sharing. I plan to participate in learning linguistics during the rest of the semester by continuing to refine these notes, and be able to share them during my note sharing slot.\n\nIn terms of learning, I learn best from examples and from structured notes. By structured notes, I mean having the vocabulary we need to know laid out, like in the paper handouts we have in class. This structure helps me figure out exactly what I need to know, and examples do that as well. Really I just enjoy the structure of the class and don't have any suggestions.","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.424918391Z","tags":null},"/Daily/2022-01-26-Wednesday":{"title":"","content":"Tags: #daily #flashcards \n\n### Wednesday, Jan 26\nFirst day using Obsdian and first day of classes they seem boring and I hate personal essay assignments also I had things to say here but forgot to write them","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.424918391Z","tags":null},"/Daily/2022-01-27-Thursday":{"title":"","content":"Tags: #daily #flashcards \n\n### Thursday, Jan 27\nNo class on Thursdays which is weird I wish I could find a way to fit a CS class in my schedule also I did nothing productive today I hope I'm not already burnt out of my routine after like two days I did take a night shower tho I've got a four day night shower streak and I read a lot today but I also played a lot of Minecraft\n\nI did one assignment actually I renewed the SAS accomodation but actually I didn't renew anything because I don't need to renew the AC accomodation but that's one less thing to worry about now","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.424918391Z","tags":null},"/Daily/2022-01-28-Friday":{"title":"","content":"Tags: #daily #flashcards \n\n### Friday, Jan 28\nI was so so so sleepy when I got up at 10 today I'm gonna have to start powering through because I feel like it'll only get more difficult to wake up on time.

I think I can make it there on time ish because we got let out of calc 2 minutes late. Once I was settled I felt really relaxed I like that class I think it'll be interesting. After ling I had an hour to kill before the ling workshop so I walked around downtown, I should visit the soap place again and get something nice. Ling workshop was kinda boring but it's cool it's in the same room that data structures was in so that's my third class in that room. After that I was cold and hungry but before the caf I went to the library to print math labs, then I went to the caf and had soup it was so good also Maddie showed up and we talked, got Ben and Jerrys at the caf shop now I'm back at the dorm writing this it is 6pm and tonight hopefully is bedwars\n\nIn terms of work I finished the ling lab at the caf and did a little of math lab 0 and wow I don't know how to do a lot of it mostly the trigonometry stuff I'm gonna have to make flashcards or whatever about the unit circle.\n\nAlso I love these uniqlo pants yesterday I felt gross and I think its all because I was wearing sweatpants but today I wore clothes I liked and was more productive and less self conscious.\n\nI'm going to try and make a second Obsidian vault and that one will have my class notes and I'll experiment with the spaced repetition plug ins there\n\nI think today is a good example of a balanced day even though I didn't think I'd have very much energy.

I really don't know how to do this in a way that like makes sense and can be done easily after every class. Maybe I need to give up on having math notes in obsidian or find some other way to form them. I also want to add a blurb in [[🎯MATH112 Hub]] for every like unit and topic that explains the topic with the context of everything else we learn so that I can connect these ideas which is also what obsidian is all about\n\nLike today we started 7.4 and its like integrating rational functions and so if I can contextualize that with reference to like the division rule for derivatives and how it's kind of like doing that backwards (if it even is I dont know but this is what I should fin out), then I can compartmentalize this stuff in my mind I guess and make it easier to know when I see an integral what I should be doing to solve it\n\nAnyways also I have these action points but then I lose them because I don't have them in a neat reference list like my Notion homepage do I just need to be referencing these in Notion? Can I make a nice table like I have in Notion in Obsidian and just use Obsidian? No idea and I wouldn't want to use just Obsidian because I have lots of stuff in Notion but I also don't wanna retype everything you know I'll retype my action items in Notion right now\n\nTranscribe 7.4 notes that's a cute little thing what if I did that tomorrow when I woke up?

I think I could glean some habits from that\n\nI like his idea of a virtual commute (I mean I have a real commute but on days like Thursday with no class I can implement this) where he will check his notifications and read a chapter of a book or something for an hour or so after he wakes up that sounds nice\n\nI was thinking this morning I could be so productive I could start working right now instead of showering and walking to class and having school stomach well maybe I can do that tomorrow do a little bit of work in the morning just transcribing those notes it should take like 15 minutes and it's actually the opposite of the virtual commute thing so explaining that did not matter but still if I can do a little task when I wake up I can feel productive even when I play skyblock for 5 hours after that\n\nAnyways my tasks for the rest of the day\n- Ask Emma if she wants to do the hack a thon?\n- I should play the game jam games lol I keep forgetting\n- Read crime and punishment I have to start! At least 1 page today or however kindle organizes it idk 100 sections\n- Really nothing I have to do right now I'm tired and sore I can afford to put this stuff off for a day or two\n\nOk maybe I'll just sit on this bench for a while and then go back to the dorm and play creeper world 3 or something I can't believe it's 5pm I was like classes are done it's only like 1pm but no that was last

You know rules\n- These things combine to allow you to generate and understand complex words productively\n\nLexical access : the proces of identifyinh words, or retrieving them from your mental dictionary\nOn average: 4-5 syllables per second, 100-130 words per minute\nYou are doing lexical retrieval at a rate of once every 0.5 seconds!\n\nLexical decision task: see a string of letters on the screen, decide if it is an English word or not\nThis is what we just did in the lab experiment\nTells us how long it takes you to access a word in your lecixon\nWe can compare how long it takes you to find a word in your lexicon\n\nThe conditions of our study\n- No affix - free morphemes\n- real affix - words that have one affix - runner, decode\n- pseudo affix - appear to have an affix - father, resume\n- nonce no affix - novel words that do not appear to have affixes\n- nonce affix - novel words that appear to have an affix\n\nWe expect words with an affix to take longer to parse because we are looking at the root in order to decide if the word is real\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.428918362Z","tags":null},"/Daily/2022-03-06-Sunday":{"title":"","content":"Tags:

allow language to combine\n- sounds (~30 distinct sounds)\n- words (~60,000)\n- sentences (unlimited)\nthis system allows us to generate infinite new sentences\nthis means we need a system for processing and mapping words onto syntactic structures in a way that is very fast, efficient, and flexible\n\ncan we see evidence of people building structure in real time\n- are we building structure as we go?\n- or waiting until we get enough information to be sure about structure?\nmethod\n- \"self-paced reading\"\n- reading sentences word by word\n- comprehension questions after\n\nWe can give participants a predictable end to a sentence as a baseline\n- these reaction times should be fast\nAnd compare this to a less predictable end to the sentence\n- these reactions will likely be slower as predictions are subverted\nWe read the critical word reaction time where the sentence structure becomes definite, and then the next 3 \"spillover\" words where reaction time may also slow\n\nBasic sentence - DO - Direct Object\n- NP - VP - **NP** (predictable)\n- \"the dog chased **the** children in the...\"\n- critical word **the**\nSubversive sentence - GP - Garden Path\n- NP - **PP** (unusual)\n- \"the dog chased **by** the children in...\"\n- critical word **by**\nMaybe difference is because of complexity, so we add a control for complex\nStructurally matching sentences to the GP's - MOD - Modifier\n- NP - **PP** (complex, but predicted preposition)\n- \"the dog that was chased **by** the children in...\"\n- critical word

competitive programming, current plan is to go to class this week and pick one of these courses to drop (probably the Japan literature one) and then add competitive programming back in before Tuesday bc it never fills up so there should still be a spot\n\nThen went to ra meeting it was boring then did laundry and downloaded more textbooks I got the books for software development they're recommended reading Code Complete and then one other one that seems boring then I went to Wawa got a chicken sandwich I also went yesterday but forgot to track it I got a pretzel and Oreos and junk

small and it takes a bit to transition and i had to do it 5 times in like 25 minutes so i should either take all the notes in goodnotes and then translate that to obsidian topic notes or maybe write all in excalidraw and like get an ipad keyboard or honestly i really didnt write all that much text well hmm maybe i keep a goodnotes journal for this class and then i add like figure numbers to reference in obsidian because im still writing definitions but if im gonna do that i might as well just keep doing this\nok in class ipad only just goodnotes then i upload those notes to obsidian as pdf as fleeting notes and then i translate those to topic notes? also i have like homework now for this class right i should do that also theres the detailed notes shes giving lets see if those are substantial and maybe i can use those\nanother important thing is that i hate writing in excalidraw it is not fun and does not feel write goodnotes is way better\n\n[[2022-08-31 CHIN303]]\nCouldn't take notes because weird no technology policy but just went over syllabus and talked about what class will be I gotta do \" the hardest reading of the whole semester probably\" now ugh\n\nHow is there another class after this I'm probably gonna drop one of these Chinese classes because it's too much for one day I won't be done until 6:30 it's too late and then soon that means it'll be dark by the time I get out of class I will die I'm gonna drop whichever alv has the most work maybe this one\n\n[[2022-08-31 CHIN309]]\n\n\nI'm so tired\nok just reorganized the whole vault basically made new folders and put every file in a folder and made a fleeting notes template so i should just be able to make the daily note then tap the class and start writing\nnow lets try to start some topic notes

cs project today but ill start with the chin reflection bc i want to get it out of the way\n\n![[2022-09-19 CHIN309#Reflection 1 rubric]]\nhere is the rubric\ni will do the 300 to 500 word writing bc thats the easiest\ni was thinking ab something like the ling reflection i did last year using notion card views or making like a timeline but im not sure how applicable either of those things are and i dont know what i want to write about\n\nwhat can i write a reflective essay about?\n- the white horses are not horses thing\n\t- talked about paradoxes in discrete so like there's a fun crossover\n- can i make any connections to readings from japn208?\n- can i make any connections to progression fantasy/xianxia/wuxia?\n\t- not really because i havent read any but cultivation would be a great topic to talk about\n\t- maybe for a future project in this class\n- \"You can simply discuss your favorite piece, something interesting that came up in class, or even discuss how you've encountered the topics at hand outside of class.\"\n\t- whats my favorite piece? maybe the analects?\n\ni just spent like 10 min making a list of the readings in [[🧧CHIN309 Hub]]\nstill not sure which one to do the reflection about\n\ncompletely unrelated just checked my obsidian graph thing\n![[Pasted image 20220929194800.png]]\nhow can anyone use this thing in any useful way\nit sure does look cool\nnothing but an onboarding tool\n\nok i still dont know what to write about\nheres an idea\ni go back to my dorm and finish my weekly dungeon or whatever before the week ends tomorrow morning and i watch videos about confucius while i do it yeah perfect great idea i could connect it to who knows probably something right? caf closes in ten min lemme grab something to eat again and then leave

are cool ig\n\ni am so demotivated and i cant get anything done\nis it a seasonal thing\nis it because i just checked grades and got a 13% in cs project 2 and a B on chin reflection and a B on the last math hw\nis it bc i hate cs301 yes definitely this one\nhow do i start enjoying programming again\ni keep getting snapchat memories from 4 years ago of me making lua games and i was actively working on that stuff outside of class\nnow i can barely work on these cs projects\ntheyre so convoluted and some parts of the instructions are very specific and hand holding but some are not and it makes it feel like im not doing it properly and i get lost\nalso i used my extension for project 3 so now i really have to get this going\nwhats my plan?\ni guess first step in the instructions is the crc cards or whatever thats a good idea i should just go through every class and figure out what they do\ni did that with the 2048 project and got it done\ni didnt do that with project 2 and i was so lost\nugh\n\nand the semester is halfway done now bc fall break is over?? thats so messed up \ni need to catch up on weekly notes\ni still have unchecked fleeting notes from like week 2 because i still havent made math topic notes\ndoes the topic note system suck\u003e? or do i just never study? \na little bit of both perhaps\n\n[[Fleeting Notes/2022-10-17 CSCI301]]\n\n---\n\n###

Living under the influence of the Enlightenment, we tend to believe that we can make autonomous decisions about our lives, and therefore view cross-border movements as personal matters.

countable\n- logic can be many things truth can have many ideas\n- focusing on coherence, start with priniciples considered true (axioms)\n- studying the logic that takes you from whatever you assume true to more truths\n\n\n### Propositional and predicate logic\n\"gonna spend a couple weeks on this\"\nstarting with proposition\n\nWhat is a proposition? def.\n\tA proposition is a statement that has a truth value; either true (T) or false (F), but not both.\n\tp, q, r, s, t - symbols we will use for propositions\n\nexamples\n\tHow much does it cost? = not a proposition\n\tThis room is ugly = not a proposition, subjective\n\tThe radius of the earth is 1km = a proposition, and a false one\n\t1 + 1 equals 2  = a proposition, true\n\t1 + 1 equals 3  = a proposition, false\n\nwhat about?\n\tx + 1 equals 2  = not a proposition, could be true or false depending on x, has no truth value\npredicate?\n\ndef.\n\tLogic dealing with propositions is called Propositional Calculus.\n\nCompound propositions can be constructed using propositions and one or more logical operators.\n\n##### Logical operators\nUnary operator - takes only one argument/proposition\n\t¬ not - flips a proposition\n\tɪ identity - leaves a proposition as is\nthese are the only operations that can be done with one prop.\n\nBinary operator - takes two arguments\n\t∧ and - conjunction\n\t∨ or - disjunction\n\t⊕ exclusive-or - one has to be true, not both - \"either-or\"\n\t→ implication/conditional - if, then (ish, we'll come back to it)\n\t↔ equivalence/biconditional\n\n##### Truth tables\nnot\n![[Pasted image 20220902112014.png]]\nonly two options\n\nand \u0026 or\n![[Pasted image 20220902112147.png]]\n4 possibilities\nand needs both true\nor needs at least one true\n\n![[Pasted image 20220902112721.png]]\nexclusive or needs exactly one true\nto the right of the exclusive or column we can see two ways to represent the exclusive or with *not*, *and*, and *or*.\np ⊕ q ≡ (p∧ ¬q)∨(¬p∧q) ≡ (p∨q)∧(¬p∨ ¬q)\n≡ means equivalent\nthis shows that are multiple, equivalent ways to write the same operation\n\nwe can use these methods to create formal proofs that prove, for example, that code will always work for all possible inputs\n\ncompound statements can become verbose\n”Either the car is a Ferrari OR the car color is red”\n≡ \"the car is a ferrari and it is not red or the car is not a ferrari and it is red\"\n≡ \"the car is a ferrari or the car is red and the car is not a ferrari or the car is not red\"\n\norder of operations is ¬,∧,∨,→,↔\nparentheses can override this order\n\n![[Pasted image 20220902114512.png]]\nif falsehood gives rise to a falsehood, the implication is true (why?)\nif falsehood gives rise to a truth, the implication is true (why?)\nif a truth gives rise to a false, then it is not an implication\nif a truth gives rise to a truth, then you have an implication\n\nthe first two lines dont make much english sense in terms of an if, then statement\nex. pythagorean theorem, if right triangle, then $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$\nif given right triangle (T), then get $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ (T)\nif given not a right triangle (F), then get $a^2 + b^2 \\neq c^2$ (F) the theorem is not wrong, just false input\n.... look into this more???\ncont on

on blackboard about starting java coding\n\n## Why is Software Development challenging?\nno repitition in an academic environment always learning something new\n\nThree basic steps in a sw project\n- Analysis - figure out what needs to be done\n\t- could be formalized into a product requirements document\n- Design - figure out how to do this\n\t- software architecture, infrastructure\n\t- different roles, software developer vs software architect\n- Implementation - just do it (right)\n\t- software\n\nthe Waterfall process model\nrequirements - design - implementation - verification - maintenance\nbad - cant go back up the waterfall - difficult to change design during implementation phase\n\n#quote\nFrom Steve McConnell, [[Code Complete]] 2e\nPercentages of development time\nIn small projects, construction activities dominate\nIn large projects, architecture, system testing, design takes up a larger percentage of time\nWant to make solid infrastructure to work with later, would be costly to change later on\n\nThe architectural design has a long term impact\n\nexamples of big software projects / memories of architectural problems\n- Y2K bug\n- Boeing Starliner

functionality issues\n\t- substantially late\n\t- poor quality\n\t- high cost variance\n\t- canceled after launch\n\t- rejected or not implemented for other reasons\n- bigger projects with higher budgets have a larger failure rate\n\nwhy is it so difficult to get this right?\n- complexity, scale, productivity, change, ...\n\nIllustration - the twisting torso skyscraper again\n- real world\n-

Problems\n- Algorithms\n- Language\n- Machine Architecture\n- Micro-architecture\n- Logic Circuits\n- Devices\n\nThere are key concepts we can see in almost all programming languages, similarities\n\nKey concepts:\n1. Hardware has separate units for integer \u0026 floating point arithmetic\n2. Control flow\n   Code resides in memory locations\n   Program counter pc says where next instruction is\n   Implicit vs Explicit \n   Implication for programming languages\n   - control flow operators\n   - if else, while, for, etc\n3. Code organized in “blocks”\n   putting lines of code together\n   starting address, parameters, code, return statements\n   operated in a call stack\n   Implication for programming languages\n   - code structured in methods/functions/procedures\n   - recursion\n4. Memory locations can be accessed for data\n   heap space\n   memory can be allocated and freed at runtime\n   Implication for programming languages\n   - command to allocate memory - in Java, `new \u003cdatatype\u003e()`\n   - command to release memory - in Java, automatic garbage collection\n   - memory holds bit patterns - in Java, uses types to avoid confusion of what content is\n   Implication for programming\n   - need to initialize new entities with meaningful bit patterns\n   - can create dynamic data structures - lists, trees, hash tables, etc. (man i forgot all about these)\n5. Hardware has memory hierarchy, (volatile and persistent)\n   visualized as a triangle\n   top levels are fast, small, and volatile - CPU caches, main memory\n   lower levels are slower, larger, and persistent - SSD, hard disk\n   Implication for programming\n   - address space resides in volatile memory at runtime\n   - input data usually resides in \"files\" on persistent storage\n   - need to have commands to work on persistent storage\n\t   - open files, read input from files, write output to files\n\t   - parse input and feed it into data structures in address space\n\nwow all these words are like mush\n\nprogramming languages naturally need to have a lot in common because of these key concepts\nthere is a need to structure large pieces of code\nthere is a need to reuse code\nimplication: mathod -\u003e class -\u003e package -\u003e library\n\n##### our to do list for learning java\n- Program execution, life cycle\n- Control flow\n- Fundamental data structures\n- Structure of large programs\n- User interaction\n- Persistent storage\n- Special topics\n\t- concurrent execution\n\t- distributed / network applications\n\t- regular execution, error handling\n- Object Orientation\n\nmore slides we didnt get to https://blackboard.wm.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-1894228-dt-content-rid-25593755_1/xid-25593755_1","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.432918334Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-09-06-JAPN208":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-09-06 Tuesday]] 13:54:04\ndescription:: Writing About Travel - analyzing [[Imperial Eyes]]\n\nstart attendance next week\nno readings for thursday, just lectures\nnext tuesday discussing isabella bird's unbeaten tracks\n- traveled to japan in late 1970s\n- will read 2 other travel logs\n\nwill finalize presentation schedule soon, most people will probably get their first choices (aka not a lot of people requested readings including me i did nothing)\n\n## Writing about travel\n##### How to conceptualize and analyze travel?\n- travel often seen as personal matter: enlightenment, global capitalism, etc.\n\t- on one level travel is a personal matter, you travel because you want to/need to for personal reasons\n\t- enlightenment - human beings are free and can make autonomous decisions\n\t- global capitalism - international travel is easier\n\t- obligatory pandemic made it difficult\n- travel as the lens through which to look at \"bigger issues\"\n\t- in [[Imperial Eyes]], imperialism\n\t\t- looking at many people's travel writing with the bigger purpose of exploring issues of imperialism\n\t- international trade\n\t- disease\n\t- persecution\n\t- education\n- need to analyze in context - political, socio-economic, and cultural\n- when examining travel from one country to another, we can take into consideration:\n\t- diplomatic relation between the two countries\n\t- history between the two countries\n\t- economic condition of each country\n\t- source of funding\n\t- cultural images of those countries\n\n##### [[Imperial Eyes]]\npurpose of this reading for us is to gain some terms and concepts for our analysis of travel writings in the upcoming weeks\n\nwhat kind of source?\n- secondary, because Pratt is analyzing other sources, interpreting other data\n\nwhat are the author's motivations and goals?\n- analyzing the european bias in travel writing\n\nterms from the reading\n\n###### contact zone\n- a zone where two cultures encounter\n- synonymous with term \"colonial frontier\"\n- often one culture is indigenous\n- uneven power balance\n- comes from the linguistic term [[Language Change III|Contact Language]]; a language that emerges when two cultures encounter, usually for trade and such\n\n###### anti-conquest\n- the European bourgeois seeking to secure their innocence while also asserting their power\n- the \"seeing-man\" - \"he whose imperial eyes passively look out and possess\"\n- helps the bourgeois feel more comfortable and justified in their actions\n- \"im just a silly little foreigner traveling in a foreign land\"\n- could also be justified as missionary work - spreading the word of God\n- propaganda to trivialize the power imbalance\n\n###### autoethnography / autoethnographic expression\n- \"instances in which colonized subjects undertake to represent themselves in ways that engage with the colonizer's own terms\"\n- ex. the *New Chronicle* talked about in the reading\n- not thought of as authentic or autochtonous forms of self-representation\n- \"If ethnographic texts are a means by which Europeans represent to themselves their (usually subjugated) others, autoethnographic texts are those the others construct in response to or in dialogue with those metropolitan representations\"\n- ex. enlightenment is a European idea; people outside of Europe using the terms of Enlightenment to represent themselves and fight against imperialism\n\n\"is the internet a contact zone?\" -

[[Unbeaten Tracks In Japan]]\n\nMany western travelers went to Japan during the Meiji era (1868 - 1912)\nWhat political and economic factors enabled and ecouraged this movement?\nHow did they experience Japan?\n\nIsabella Bird, Unbeaten Tracks in Japan, 1880\nBird traveled in Japan in 1878; what was going on in Japan circa 1878?\n\nThe Meiji Restoration\n- society was changing dramatically\n- name refers to emperor Meiji, ruled from (1868 - 1912)\n- Meiji Restoration - a series of reforms implemented by the new government in Tokyo\n- before Meiji, japan was ruled by Shogun from the Tokugawa family in Edo (1603 - 1867)\n\t- more than 200 domains, each of which ruled by Daimyo\n\t- power of Shogun was limited\n\t\t- shogun was head of samurai\n\t\t- shogun for a long time had political power, and emperor was a symbol of japan (like prime minister and the queen (RIP!))\n\t- emperor in Kyoto had no political power\n\t- -\u003e power of central govt was very limited\n\t- geographical and social mobility both very limited\n- Meiji era was an attempt to construct a strong central government\n- Western imperialism in 19th century / 1800s -\u003e need for modern centralized state\n- Tokugawa govt (Shogun govt) overthrown by alliance of anti-Tokugawa domains\n- domains worried that japan would be very weak if they didnt unify the domains\n- shogun tokugawa yoshinobu, the last tokugawa shogun 15th shogun, returns sovereignty to emperor in **1867**, end of shogun era\n\nTreaty Ports\n- Treaty of Amity and Commerce\n\t- between US and Japan **1858**\n\t- signed by 14th shogun\n\t- \"open the country. we have ships with guns. gun ships\"\n- Similar treaties with Britain, France, Russia, Netherlands\n- Five ports open for trade\n\t- Yokohama, Kobe, Hakodate, Nagasaki, Niigata\n\t- spread throughout the country\n\t- **foreigners allowed to live in these cities**\n\t- **extraterritorial rights for foreigners**\n- No tariff autonomy for Japan\n\t- trade taxes\n\t- japanese govt didnt have the power to determine tax rate\n\t- tariffs were decided by the importing countries\n\t- tax rates were very low\n- chinese merchants not allowed to live in foreign settlements until after Meiji restoration\n- foreign settlements abolished in 20th century\n\t- still see many buildings today from these settlements with architecture influenced from foreign countries staying there\n- the foreigners coming through were very rich, merchants\n\nWesterners in Japan\n- Diplomats, merchants, their families\n\t- Rich!\n- Foreign advisors for public and private sectors in early Meiji era\n\t- *oyatoi* - those hired - refers to these foreign advisors\n\t- provided knowledge and skills necessary for modernization\n\t- military, education, medicine, transportation, architecture, law, diplomacy, fine arts, etc.\n\t- Hokkaido national university - created during this time by foreign advisors\n- Tourist industry flourished, targeting Westerners\n\t- John Murray - famous writer published travel guides\n\nUnbeaten Tracks\n- Historical contextualization necessary for this reading\n\t- be able to place the significance of her writing with historical context of late 1800s\n- Contexts\n\t- Global -

Java Program Execution\na brief introduction to Java program execution and life cycle\n\nto do list\n- program execution, life cycle\n- control flow\n- fundamental data structures\n- structure of large programs\n- user interaction\n- persistent storage\n- special topics\n\t- concurrent execution\n\t- distributed / network applications\n\t- regular execution, error handling\n\nfrom source code to a running program\n- source code\n\t- what we produce, human readable language\n\t- .java\n- .class files\n\t- not human readable\n\t- intended input for java version machine\n- interpreter / virtual machine\n\t- machine specific\n\t- java version machine aka java VM\n\t- turns the .class files into code that runs on the specific platform\n\t- virtual machine provides an environment to interpret code\n\n\nexample: hellow world / red button\njavac \n- command for invoking the compiler\n- c for compiler\n\nfrom code to execution\n- step 1: javac MyProgram.java\n\t- compiles source code to byte code\n- step 2: java MyProgram\n\t- starts JVM, loads and runs byte code from .class files\n\t- classes and libraries are usually packaged ,jar archive files\n\nJVM\n- loads class files on demand\n- starts execution\n- executed commands in main method\n\t- may start additional, parallel threads\n- terminates if done with main method and all other threads\n- internally\n\t- operates execution [[Stack]] for methods and [[Heap]] for objects\n\t- performs garbage collection on heap to recycle memory\n\t\t- no references to object = not being used = can be thrown out\n\t- [ ] make data structures topic notes\n\nOperating system\n- runs JVM in a user process with own virtual address space\n- provides memory\n- provides access to devices for input/output e.g. keyboard, screen, etc\n\nWhats next?\n- look at RedButtonGUI.java for heavily annotated code to provide a brief introduction into Java programming\n\n\n## 4b. Java Control Flow\nThe notion of sequence is fundamental\n- at a conceptual level, hardwar executes low level basic instructions in sequence\n- a program is transformed into a sequence of instructions for its execution\n- each instruction is an indivicual, discrete entity\n\nin Java\n- semicolon - denotes end of command, separates commands\n- curly braces - group a set of commands into a block\n- text layout **does not** matter for Java compiler (but does for humans)\n\ncaveats\n- missing/extra  semicolons ruin everything\n\n##### methods\n- a function\n- a block of code inside a class with:\n\t- a name\n\t- a return type including void\n\t- parameters\n\t- local variables\n\t- commands\n\ninput/output\nhow does data get into a method?\n- parameters, like local variables with external initialization\n- fields, access to instance variables is shared among methods of an object\nhow do results get out of a method?\n- return type\n- parameters, if they are references\n- fields\n\n##### if then else\ndata dependent decisions\nconditional execution\n\n##### switch statement\nuseful if 1 general default case, n special cases\n```Java\nswitch(variable), {...}\n```\ncase by case enumerated as case x : ... break ;\nmultiple cases with same effect can share code\nworks with a variety of variable types\n- byte char short int primitive types\n- Byte Character Short Integer wrapper classes\n- Enum enumerated types\n- Strings  (since SE 7)\n```Java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\tswitch(args.length) {\n\tcase 0 : printErrorMsg();\n\t\tbreak;\n\tcase 1: case 2:\n\t\tprint Arguments(args);\n\t\tbreak;\n\tdefault: printArguments(args);\n\t\tbreak;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n\n##### loops\nallows for repeated execution of code block\nloop requires\n- termination criterion\n- notion of progress\n3 equivalent variants\n- for loop\n- while koop\n- do-while loop\n\ncaveats\n- for loop condition directly followed by ; \n\t- typo error tricky to spot\n- progress variable does not proceed towards termination - infinite loop\n- nested loops with mingled notions of progress\n\nfor loop java example\n```Java\nvoid printArguments(String[] args) {\n\tfor (int i = 0; i \u003c args.length; i++) {\n\t\tString str = i + \"-th parameter: \" + args [i];\n\t\tSystem.out.println(str);\n\t}\n}\n```\n```Java\nvoid printArguments(String[] args) {\n\tint i = 0;\n\tfor (String s : args) {\n\t\tString str = i + \"-th parameter: \" + s;\n\t\tSystem.out.println(str);\n\t\ti++;\n\t}\n}\n```\nwhile loop java example\n```Java\nvoid printArguments(String[] args) {\n\tint i = 0;\n\twhile (i \u003c args.length) {\n\t\tString str = i + \"-th parameter: \" + s;\n\t\tSystem.out.println(str);\n\t\ti++;\n\t}\n}\n```\ndo while loop java example\nwhy use this?\n\"does the code once for sure, then can go back and do it again if necessary\"\n```Java\nvoid printArguments(String[] args) {\n\tint i = 0;\n\tdo {\n\t\tString str = i + \"-th parameter: \" + args[i];\n\t\tSystem.out.println(str);\n\t\ti++;\n\t} while (i \u003c args.length);\n}\n```\n\n##### Basic Exception Handling\nwhat if execution hits an error situation?\ncontrol flow for normal vs exceptional situations?\njava separates code for execution handling\n\nkey idea: \"passing a hot potato along\"\n- method that hits a problem it cant handle returns by throwing an exception, ie control flow switches toward exception handling\n- calling method can either \"catch\" and handle exception or pass it on\n- working down the execution stack, this ultimately leads to a program termination with a failure message.\n\nex. NullPointerException\n```Java\nString name = null;\nint n = name.length(); \u003c- ERROR\n...\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NullPointerException\nat Greeter.sayHello(Greeter.java:25)\nat GreeterTest.main(GreeterTest.Java:6)\n```\n- if a variable does not refer to an object its value is null\n- calling method on null value is not possible\n- common programming error\n- unless there is a handler, program exits with stack trace\n\ncatching exceptions\n```Java\ntry\n{\n\t//code that might throw an IOException\n}\ncatch\n{\n\t//take corrective action\n}\n```\ncorrective action can be\n- notify user of error and open dialog with selection of remedies\n- log error in error report file\n- common but unsatisfactory: print stack trace and exit\n```Java\nexception.printStackTrace();\nSystem.exit(1);\n```\nlame ^\n\nThe finally Clause\n- cleanup needs to occur during normal and exceptional processing\n```Java\ntry\n{\n\treader = new FileReader(name);\n\t...\n}\n//can add a catch block here too\nfinally\n{\n\tif (reader != null) reader.close();\n}\n```\n\nChecked and Unchecked Exceptions\nexceptions can be compiler checked and unchecked\nexamples\n- NullPointerException is not checked\n- IOException is checked\n\nunchecked - due to programming errors, compilers not gonna do anything about it\nchecked - foreseeable problems the compiler finds\n\ntwo approaches to dealing with checked exceptions\n- propagate - declare the exception in the method header\n- handle - catch the exception with the catch, finally, code from before\nhot potato\n\npropagating - declaring checked exceptions\n```Java\npublic void read(String filename) throws FileNotFoundException\n{\n\tFileReader reader = new FileReader(filename);\n\t...\n}\n```\n\ni dont get why you would propagate like this, i guess if the error doesnt matter?\n\nsummary\n- control flow -  sequence, loops, conditional execution\n- method calls - getting data in and out of methods\n- normal operation vs exception handling\n\n\n## 4c. Structure of Java Programs\nnote: this video does not cover modules, will need to check another tut for that, some linked in blackboard page for 1.4c\n\nHow do we structure large programs?\n- at a conceptual/design level -\u003e will talk about more later\n\t- object oriented design, class design\n\t- software design patterns and software architecture\n- at a language level, Java offers\n\t- Packages reside in directories, get packed into libraries (jar files)\n\t- Classes reside in files\n\t- Methods reside in Classes\n\n##### methods\n- functions\n- talked about alrdy\n- a method with different number of parameters (and different types) counts as different from another method, even with same name\n- methods reside inside a class\n```Java\n//create method inside class MyClass\nint mymethod(int i) {\n\treturn i;\n}\n\n//instantiate an object of class MyClass\nMyClass c = new MyClass();\n\n//call method mymethod or object c\nc.mymethod();\n```\nspecial case: call a static method in a class\n```Java\nstatic int mymethod(int i){\n\treturn i;\n}\n\n//call directly using class name\n//this method can only take advantage of static variables,\n//not instance variables\nMyClass.mymethod();\n```\n\n##### classes and objects\nclass name and file name needs to match\n- 1 class 1 file (usually)\n- special case: inner class within another class\n- special case: anonymous classes, we'll see that later\n\nclass integrates data and algorithms\n- several class variables of various kinds\n- several methods\n\nencapsulation / data hiding / information hiding\n- methods are publicly available (public) or secret (private)\n\t- reduces complexity when interfacing with a class\n- hiding information like this also called \"encapsulation\"\n- data / class variables are typically private and hidden\n- methods mainly operate on class internal data\n\nwhat is good class design?\n- key question for later\n\ncommon use case for classes: class is instantiated into object\n- each instance has own set of instance variables\n- code for methods is shared\n\nspecial use case for classes: static code\nstatic methods\n- no instantiation necessary to call a method\n- example: `public static void main(String[] args)`\n- typically used for stateless functions, ex. `sqrt()` in Math\nstatic variables\n- no instantiation necessary to access variables\n- much like shared variables, either globally or among instances of a class\n- static variables are prime suspects for memory leaks!\n\t- garbage collection cant recognize if static variable that refers to an object is ever going to be needed again, never recycles memory that a static variable refers to\n\t- if you dont release the memory, it wont be released by garbage collection\n\n##### packages\nclasses are grouped into packages\n- package names are dot-separated identifier sequences\n\t- java.util\n\t- javax.swing\n\t- com.sun.misc\n\t- edu.wm.cs.cs301.slidingpuzzle\n\t- as seen in these examples, naming goes from most general to -\u003e special\n- add package statement to top of file\n\t- `package edu.wm.cs.cs301.slidingpuzzle;`\n- class without package name is in default package\n\t- sloppy\n\t- not cool\n\nfull name of class = package name + class name\nimportant for compiler that this full name is unique\n\npackage name must match subdirectory name\n- edu.wm.cs.cs301.slidingpuzzle.FastPuzzleSolver.java\n- must be in subdirectory:\n\t- basedirectory/edu/wm/cs/cs301/slidingpuzzle\n\nalways compile from the base directory\n- `javac edu/wm/cs/cs301/slidingpuzzle/FastPuzzleSolver.java`\nalways run from the base directory\n- `java edu/wm/cs/cs301/slidingpuzzle/FastPuzzleSolver`\n\nImporting Packages\ntedious to write or read full class names in code\n`import` allows you to use short class name\n\n```Java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\n...\nArrayList a;\n//dont have to write out java.util.ArrayList a;\n```\n\ncan import all classes from a package\n- `import java.util.*;`\ncannot import from multiple packages\n- `import java.*.*;` \u003c- no\n\nif a class occurs in two imported packages, import is no help\n```Java\nimport java.util.*;\nimport java.sql.*;\n...\njava.util.Date d;\n//Date also occurs in java.sql, so have to specify full name\n```\n\nnote: never need to import java.lang bc used commonly\nimported by default\n\n##### libraries\npackages can be packed into libraries for use/reuse\nlibraries are archive files (suffix .jar)\nnot a java language mechanism\n\n##### summary\n- basic tools for structuring code\n- methods - block of code\n- classes - files\n- packages - directories\n- libraries - archives\n\n\n## 4d. Primitive Types in Java\nim getting tired of this its been 1h44min\n\neight primitive types\n- byte\n- short\n- int\n- long\n- float\n- double\nfinite range - be careful of underflow, overflow\nfloating point - not real values, finite subset - be careful of floating point round errors\n\nconversion via typecast\n```Java\nfloat pif = 3.14F;\ndouble pi = 3.14159265;\n\nint x = (int)pi;\n//x = 3\n\npif = pi;\n//pif = 3.14.15927\n//pif loses one decimal place of precision at the end\n```\n\noperations for floating point and integral types\ncomparison \u003c \u003c= \u003e= \u003e and equality == !=\nunary sign + -\nmath operations + -

later a philosophical text\n\"really a simple short concise text\"\nmade up of 8 trigrams $\\equiv$ different symbols\nyang = unbroken lines\nyin = broken lines\n8 trigrams come together to form 64 hexagrams\nif a divination process results in one, the yi jing is a reference for them\n\nbook of changes pg 5-7 from the reading (LOL)\n- \"note how esoteric, terse this is\"\n\t- \"a submerged dragon\"\n\t- \"nobles throughout the day\"\n\t- \"see a group of dragons without heads: auspicious\"\n- \"not necessarily easy to understand as a reader, modern or contemporary\"\n- very vague guidances, have produced a lot of interpretation\nsome people have associated this book with the oracle bones, but used in other ways, other ways these hexagrams are generated\n\nhe said \"check out this youtube video for more info\" but i cant find the link\n\n##### The Book of Documents\nknown as one of the five confucian classics\nlays the way for confucian thought\nconfucius was ostensibly the original compiler of this text, not clear if he really did\none of the earliest collections of \"literary material\"\n\nrecord of events and speeches\nsplit into 4 parts\n- 1st focused on __ the great\n- xia dynasty\n- shang dynasty\n- jo dynasty\n\nfocused on an \"old vs new\" controversy\naround 220 bc, emperor espoused legalism, demanded books not according to this be burned\nscholars of the time tried to rewrite what was lost from memory, called the new texts\noriginal copies were found (hidden in confucius' estate), now called the old texts\nlot of arguments over which of these are more valid than the others\n\noldest prose in chinese known history\n\nTsinghua bamboo strips\nAn illustration of Emperor Yao from The Imperially Commissioned Pictorial Book Of Documents, 1902\nThe Councils of Kao-Yao\n- framed as a conversation between __ the great, who became the king after developing a flood control plan to control the rivers, was given the throne, Shun(?) was passed the throne from Yao(?)\n- he reads a excerpt im not gonna write it out but very philosophical \"what makes a man virtuous\" laid out dualistically, opposing characteristics in pairs\n\n##### The Book/Classic of Odes/Songs\n\"will spend more time talking about this because I cant teach this class without talking about this\"\nthe oldest collection of poetry from China\noldest thing that might be considered truly \"literature\"\n305 poems originally accompanied with music 9th to 7th centuries bc, 200 year span\npeople tend to read these politically and historically in the early days, today might think of these more abstractly\nlater scholars tend to think of these as literary and less political\n\nsplit into parts\n- Airs of the States\n\t- 160 poems\n\t- mostly folk songs\n\t- seen as a reflection on common culture\n- Lesser Ya\n\t- court hymns, ritual songs\n- Greater Ya\n\t- court hymns, ritual songs\n- Temple Hymns (Eulogies)\n\t- performed as part of sacrifical rites\n\nfirst poem - The Ospreys\n- organized in stanzas, rhymes (in Chinese)\n- two parallel narratives in this poem\n\t- one related to people, one related to nature\n- confucius talks about this particular poem in the Analects\n\t- \"joy without wantoness, sorrow without self-injury\"\n\t- \"desire to moralize all literature, very confucian thing\"\n- can be read as criticism of a contemporary king that is not behaving properly\n- can be read as praise of a specific king/queen\nreconstructed pronunciation vs modern mandarin pronunciation, fascinating difference, we will look at later\nLegge vs. Pound - different English translations of the poem\n- Pound's translation is very different, we'll talk about this in class\n- Pound didn't actually read Chinese\n- discussion on him later\n\n\nend of video\nso what readings do i need to do?\n- Columbia pp. 3-11 : divinations and inscriptions\n- Columbia pp. 61-73 : classics of poetry and documents\n\nand then it says for sept 12. need to read\n- Lao Tzu - Dao De Jing chapters 1 - 20\n\n\n---\n\nin class notes 9/12\nstarting by going back through the slides from the online lecture video\n\n##### A brief timeline of early China\n![[Timeline of Chinese Dynasties.png]]\n\n##### Oracle bone inscriptions\nis this literature? some people will say no\ndoes \"literature\" need to have artistic intent?\n\n##### The Book of Documents\na good example of collections of essays that provide guidance to people\n\"artistic intent?\"\nConfucius\n\ntsinghua bamboo slips\n- excavated in China\n- the evidence of these documents\n\nnew text tradition vs. old text tradition\n- burning books\n- Qin Dynasty. (221–206 BC) was based on legalism, competing books were burned\n- after Qin dynasty, philosophers/historians/officials wrote down what they remember of the books, this is what was used for a long time\n- later, copies of the original books were discovered in Confucius' estate, hidden\n- so which texts are used now?\n- \"talk about this later, this is jumping ahead\"\n\n##### The book of odes\nearliest poetry we have\n4 sections\n- folk poetry, largest portion\n- court hymns, \"lesser and greater\"\n- eulogies\n\nconsists of 4-syllable rhyming lines\nwhen we read these, we often read them in modern dialects\nthe way they would have been pronounced when they were written is significantly different\nex. first poem, the ospreys (idk if both videos are of this poem)\nhttps://youtu.be/kKQcFFhWSYo here is what the original might have sounded like\nhttps://youtu.be/saUqqJ2nhIQ a the ospreys in modern dialect\nthese poems were accompanied by music, mostly if not completely lost now\ntranslation - many differences in how these poems are translated\n\nwill see more translation issues today with the dao de jing\n\n\n## Lao Tzu's [[Dao De Jing]]\nvery complex, hard to understand\nlots of interpretations over time, which add to the \"mythos\" of it\n\ncalled the Lao Tzu - who these works are often associated with\nor the Dao De Jing - could translate to \"The Book of the Way and of Virtue\"\n\nrhymes\n\npeople believed the \"sage\" Lao Tzu lived ~50yr before Confucius\nim getting major Way of Kings vibes tbh is that wrong\n\nthe story goes that Confucius sought Lao Tzu's advice on how to properly conduct the rites\nwhat he supposedly told Confucius\n\n#quote \"What you are talking about concerns merely the words left by people who have rotted along with their bones. . . .

names\nshe at least admired the natural beauty of Japan\nshe describes people with a lot of weird descriptions like measurements of height and stuff\nshe describes the japanese people in terms of european standards\nseemed like she really didnt wanna be there\nshe put a big emphasis at the start about being one of the first european woman to travel japan\ngap in letters - we skipped some parts - her descriptions changed from negative to more respectful\n\n##### article about Bird\n(get link)\nshows her travel route\n\n##### presentations\n1878\n10 years into meiji era\njapan was becoming more open to international affairs, travel, trade\nrecommended to travel for her health\nautoethnography - officials and other Japanese people adopting European clothing\n\ngrowing up Bird had spinal pain among other health issues, doctors recommended travel\nsee her prejudice against japanese through her writing\nshe was able to get an \"untainted\" view of japanese people, villages, culture\nin tokyo/yokohama, meets with a lot of europeans -\u003e mentions names of european people, but almost never japanese people\nswarmed by natives who havent seen foreigners before in smaller villages\ncontact zone - the college in niigata\ndouble contact zone - aino people affected by japanese govt, japanese govt affected by western forces\nanti conquest - Bird is paving the way through these \"unbeaten tracks\" for more travellers\nauto ethnography - aino people use japanese artifacts for their own significance\n\n##### discussion questions\nwhat enabled Bird to go to japan? what made her interested in japan?\n- port cities\n- infrastructure to take her to japan, to take care of her\n- her status as educated, good background, allowed her this opportunity\n- she had existing connections in japan, european people in tokyo she talked to\n- stories at this time that romanticize traveling to foreign lands, being the first to go there\n- unification of japan with meiji restoration allowed her to leave the port cities and travel the interior\n- steam boats - technology to enable travel\n\nit's pretty amazing that almost all of her journey she was walking or on horse\nmust have been very difficult\nroads were not well kept\npg 67 \"Good roads are really the most pressing need of Japan.\"\n\nduring her travel what did she pay attention to?\n- scenery, landscapes, mountains, rice fields\n\t- \"apparently the year she went was an usually rainy year\"\n- talks a lot about living conditions, what she liked or didnt, what commodities she missed, how other people lived, what made their health worse\n- mentioned kuruma a lot - man-pulled cart\n- talks about food, how she got used to it, how much she missed meat and european food\n- does not talk about politics, economy, things that werent directly connected to her trip\n- talks a lot about bodies, what people look like, facial structure\n- appearance, clothes, differences in appearance\n\t- used quasi scientific language to describe these people she encounters\n- differences in foreign influences vs the parts of japan that have not been influenced\n\nwhat relations did she build with people in japan?\n- she visits many different places and talks to many people\n- doesnt really individualize japanese people, doesnt give names\n- when crowds formed around to see her, very reverently\n- two occasions where she helps sick children, word spreads, and then more people want her help\n- description of aino people vs japanese people is very different\n\t- uses the words \"savage\" \"ugly\" \"uncivilized\" but then calls them \"fascinating\" \"attractive\"\n\t- takes a lot more time describing details of the aino; in othere locations she focused on western influence, but the aino did not yet have that influence\n\t- finds the aino superior, thinks they are stronger, thinks they look more like europeans than asians\n\nthrough her writings, what can we tell about european sensibilities in the late 19th century?\n- very different from today\n- racism and prejudice\n- used to cleanliness, not used to poverty\n- not much diversity in britain, differences in appearance/ethnicity rarely seen\n- always talking about clothing\n- judging through appearances, not through actions\n- different kinds of manners, ways to show respect\n- did she enjoy her trip?\n\t- mixed feelings\n\t- complained a lot, but also had a lot of good things to say, especially about the manners/politeness of the japanese\n\nwe talked about contact zone and anti conquest last week. can we apply these concepts?\ncontact zone\n- different levels of contact seen all throughout her journey in areas of different population\n- bird herself was a moving contact zone\n\t- her letters represent contact in a eurocentric point of view\n\t- she met many japanese people for the first time, she was the first foreigner many of the japanese people had seen\n\t- there were crowds following her to see the foreigner\n- tokyo\n\t- finding a translator, looking for people who speak english\n\t- many european there, lots of influence\n- aino region, very little european contact\nanti conquest\n- in the preface, says her travel is for her own health, tries to justify the rest of her mixed opinions throughout the work\n- says her work is intellectual to justify it, but her work can do harm\n- european viewpoint, talks about how nice and respectful and polite japanese people are, but also says that they corrupt european children\n- compared all the standards in japan to the ones she was used to in britain\n- when she was traveling was she aware of the power she had?\n\t- doesnt seem like she is\n\t- very negligent of this land and these people, inhuman study of them, thinks they are lower than her\n\t- doesnt appreciate \"insufficient english\" that second language speakers had\n\t- her views dont change much from the beginning to the end\n\nas a primary document, what values and significances does this book have?\n- very eurocentric view, but one of the first views of someone from outside of japan experiencing the culture, land, people\n- racist, but still provides information on japan among english speaking people\n- biggest value is this is like a time capsule, including many aspects like what japan was like, difference in amount of contact throughout the country, european feelings toward japan, and more\n- many primary travel logs like this come from soldiers, nobility, etc.; Bird is just a traveler, is able to focus on the \"mundane\" aspects\n- shows difference in treatment of women in japanese culture vs european culture\n- how does this work read to japanese people?\n\t- still useful, not many works like this even in japanese, not many writers that have traveled, especially since country is only recently starting to open up\n\t- gives insight to how rural japan lives\n\t- very valuable to english speaking readers outside of japan AND japanese speaking readers in japan\n\nhow would you summarize the reading in a word/phrase?\n- honest\n- englightening\n- spiritual condition is much different than physical\n- unique, novel\n- biased\n\nmy summary\n- (unintentionally) paving the way\n\t- one of the first to travel like this and write about it\n\t- paved the way for more to do it\n\t- not necessarily intentionally had this outcome","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.432918334Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-09-14-CHIN309":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-09-14 Wednesday]] 17:02:34\ndescription:: discussing Confucius and [[The Analects]]\n\nlast reading, the Dao De Jing, gave the idea that chinese philosophy is confusing\nthe analects, read in comic book format\ndesigned to convey a conversational nature of the ideas in the book\n\n\n##### Historical background\nso far back, its legend\nlearned from archeological info\n\nmeritocracy was one of the fundamental guiding principles\n\n3 sovereigns 5 emperors essentially demigods\n\nxia dynasty\n- throne is inherited\n- emperors get worse and worse\n- empire falls apart and someone else has to take over\nshang dynasty\n- founder of shang dynasty overtook the throne from last evil emperor\n- descendants of shang thought they had divine right to rule\n- (see this again and again) shang dynasty founded by benevolent rulers, throne gets passed down, things get worse and worse, eventually next dynasty takes over\nzhou dynasty\n- tries to set itself up as inheritors of early shang dynasty's king's right to rule\n\t- had to come up with some way of justifying why they deserved to rule\n\t- mandate of heaven\n\t\t- not necessarily direct lineage from a \"(god)\" that allows you to rule, but the ability to rule\n\t- when one becomes unworthy to rule, someone else inherits the mandate\n\t- some historians argue that the zhou dynasty made up the xia dynasty in order to justify overthrowing the shang\n\t- the xia had it and lost it to the shang, the shang had it and now lose it to the zhou\n- shift in ideas in what is needed in order to rule\n\t- not just controlling things, but ruling ethically\n- zhou dynasty begins to hit rocky times just like dynasties before, and they feel the danger that they will lose it\n- nobles start to fight amongst themselves\n-  -\u003e here is where confucius enters the picture\n- social norms are breaking down, states are warring\n\n##### Confucius\nborn near the end of zhou dynasty\nunlike lao tzu, it is undisputed confucius was a real person\nborn in a state that had its roots in shang dynasty, still has culture etc of early zhou dynasty\nnot able to leverage family's influence, not born from wealth\nmay have worked in lower positions in the govt\nspent his life teaching people how to go around and teach others how to govern\n- his disciples have a lot of influence later\n- confucius' students went on to work for many people confucius hated\nanglization of his name - comes from master con, or something idk but it wasnt confucius\ncredited with creating the five classes\n- collections of various earlier texts\n- weve seen the book of documents\n- others\n- the analects\n\t- major repository of his teachings\n\t- some think it was compiled by his students\n\n##### [[The Analects]]\nmany versions, many contradicting passages\nrepresents one piece of a larger system of thought\na lot of what we think of as Confucian philosophy has changed since this was first circulated\nthere were many schools of thought around Confucius' time\ndoesn't see a lot of success until 200-300 years after his death (see Han dynasty)\n\nthe model of governance\n- the government/state should mimic a family\n\nrelation with deities\n- generally avoids mention of supernatural\n- except to the extent that people should follow the old rituals\n\ncommunity depends on people caring for each other\nnurture first, teach second, govern last\nconfucius believes the shang dynasty doesnt start to fail until it stops caring about people\n\nritual\n- becomes a way for rulers to fulfill their obligations to society\n- ex. performing rituals to ensure a good harvest\n- confucius is not interested in gods, etc, interested in how to run a state\n\npower dynamics\n- the government's responsibilities to the people\n\nthe gentleman\n- the primary goal of any personm particularly a learned person, is to become a gentleman\n- this concept of a gentleman *prior to this was someone of aristocratic birth*\n- confucius redefines this to be someone of craft and learnedness\n\t- cultivation!\n\nDao vs. Confucius\n- the dao is something that just is\n- for confucius, people need to act in order for things to go well\n\nhumanity\n- reverent\n- selfless\n- concern for others\n- benevolence\n\nfilial piety\n- respect for elders/parents\n- \"Xiao, or filial piety, is an attitude of respect for parents and ancestors in societies influenced by Confucian thought. Filial piety is demonstrated, in part, through service to one's parents.\"\n\nother key terms\n- duty\n- heaven - natural processes\n\n\n##### looking at the readings\n1:1 reflecting on what it means to be noble\nsometimes its confucius saying something, sometimes its his students\n1:2 filial piety\n- if youre thoughtful towards your parents -\u003e will be thoughtful towards superiors in society -\u003e will not cause trouble in society\n- all comes back to how you treat your family/elders\n1:3 mirrors 1:1\nthroughout these verses, gaining a set of prescriptions on how to act with others/in society/towards ourselves/in leadership\n1:5 even if youre doing the right things, critical you do them at the right time\n1:6 be honest, care for others around you, finally, study if you have time\n\nquestion \"did he think about how if youre a peasant you will most likely be unable to study\"\nprobably not, mostly thinking about people who would be advising to kings\ngenerally confucius avoids talking about starting point in society\n\nquestion \"fascism and confucianism\"\nearly critique that this is just saying to do what your parents say and be obedient and stuff\nscholars refuted that it's a part of it but also the govt has obligations to the people\n\n1:8 \"the gentleman\"\nemphasis on self correction\n\n2:3 the educated person will be shamed into behaving properly because they know it is bad if they are educated\nif youre only afraid of doing crimes out of being punished then thats not good enough\nyou should be able to set the standard as a benevolent ruler\n\"the perception that others would be disappointed is critical here\"\n\n2:4 famous one\nits never too late to start\n\"when i was fifteen i set my mind on learning\"\n\"by thirty i was well established\"\n\"by forty\" etc\n\n2:7 dont just provide for parents materially, emotional responsibility, feel deep respect for your parents\n\n2:13 \"a gentleman puts his words into actions before putting his actions into words\"\n\nthink of how this is different from daoism\nwould a daoists rules for governance look like this? no not at all really\nthats why daoism becomes more of a personal philosophy and not a governing one\n\n2:14 idea of the small person as the opposite of the gentleman\n\n2:15 general guidance on how to go about study\nstudy without reflection is folly\nreflection without study is risky\n\n2:16 to become an expert in outlandish ideas is simply harmful\npossibly critique of daoism / other teachings\n\n3:7 a gentlemen does not contend, but when he must, he does it through archery\nanother translation\n\tthe master said, the noble minded never contend\n\tit is true that archery is a kind of contention, but they bow/then compete/descend and bow again/exchange toasts\nthe lesson is in good sportsmanship / competing is ok with ritual attached to it / respect\n\nquestion \"where would confucius draw the line in contention/challenging other schools of thought like daoism\"\nis contention in study different from this kind of competition?\n\nsaying we need to have rituals in order to have these contentions and perform amicably\n\n3:15 asking questions, being humble rather than presuming to know everything - this is proper ceremony\n\n3:17 the sacrificial goat\n\"zigong, what you care about is the goat, what i care about is the ceremony\"\nsaying zigong is being stingy, the details arent as critical as the ceremony itself\n\nconfucius' relationship with his students is interesting, some presented as brilliant, some not as smart\n\n3:19 confucius talking to a sovereign\ngovernment obligations to the people\nruler acts in accordance of ritual with ministers, gives them the freedom to do what they need to do\n\n5:9 (skipping ahead) yan hui\n\"neither of us are as good as he is\"\nconfucius talks about yan hui throughout his works with regret, because he died young (pour one out for my guy)\nconfucius' relationship with yan hui is fascinating\n\n4:3 4:4 shows yan hui as a good student (RIP)\n\n4:12 \"if you only follow self interest people will resent you\" a lot of verses are just advice on how to act\n\n4:17 \"when you see someone (better than you) emulate them, when you see someone (bad) reflect and make sure you do not share their qualities\"\n\n5:15 the meaning of \"cultured\"\nadvice for rulers - dont be so high and mighty that you cant listen to thsoe below you\n\n12:2 the golden rule\n\"do not treat others how you dont like to be treated\"\n\n\nwas he intending for us to learn from his mistakes?\ndid he have a conflated ego?\nis he setting himself up to be the paragon of virtue?

i \u003c s.length(); i++)\n\th = 31 * h + s.charAt(i);\n```\nusing 31 here - base 31 - the multiplying makes it \"weighted\"\nif it was 10, and the string was \"1234\", you would see it resembles decimals\n\n##### common pitfall with hashing\ngiven\n- a set S implemented with hashing\n- S contains objects of type X\n- X has private field f and get set methods for f\n- we override equals and hashcode\n- hashcode is based on fields of X, in particular, on f\n\nscenario\n- add object x to set S\n- find x in S -\u003e ok\n- modify x using x.setf()\n- find x in S -\u003e fails\n\nproblem\n- hashcode of x gives a different value after modification\n- cant find x anymore\n\nsolution\n- several solutions\n- could remove x from hash, then update, then add it back in\n\nSummary\n- equals(Object obj)\n\t- common to override\n\t- eclipse supports boilerplate code, but you need to decide specifics\n\t- java goes by signatures; equals(YourClass y) is different\n\t- goes hand in hand with hashCode()\n- hashCode()\n\t- used to locate the right bin for element in hash table\n\t- side constraint - equal objects go in same bin\n\t- general rule - if you override equals() you need to also override hashCode()\n- Hashing support with HashSet, HashMap\n\t- update requires you to remove and reinsert modified element to be store it in the correct bin \n\n\n## Interfaces and Polymorphism\nan interface\n- is a list of method signatures\n- can inclulde definition of constants\n- is located in a file of same name\n- can extend another interface (inheritance)\n- can not be instantiated, does not include code\n\n![[Pasted image 20220915120153.png]]\n\n- an interface can be seen as a contract, as a role to play\n- a class can implement one or more interfaces\n\t- by providing actual code for list of methods in each interface\n\t- it can play different roles; it can be used in different ways\n\n![[Pasted image 20220915120313.png]]\n\nkey concept to develop generic reusable code.\nseparating class usage from class implementation has potential\n- a single class can implement several interfaces\n\t- can be used in different ways\n- multiple classes can implement the same interface\n\t- the unterface use calss can work with objects of different kind\n- a vcariable can be of interface type\n\t- only interface methods can be executed\n\nleads to polymorphism\nPolymorphism\n- refers to the ability to call *different methods of same name* based on the actual type of an object\nwhat does this all mean?\n- different classes with methods of the same name and we can call them\nso what?\n\n![[Pasted image 20220915120904.png]]\n- when you call JoeDoe.drives() it doesnt matter if he is a richmond driver, williamsburg driver!\n- can just call drives and go\n- gives a lot of flexibility\n\nExample taken from Chapter 4 of Object Oriented Design \u0026 Patterns C.

Chapters - 23 through 33\nnot originally in this format\nedited by Guo Xiang d. 312\ncommon theory is that chapters 1 through 7 were written by Zhuangzhi, and the rest were not\n\ntwo strands of Daoism\nDaoism detailing the structure of the universe\nDaoism practiced by people\nthere are people who become interested in Daoism in order to obtain immortality, supernatural power; these ideas show up in the Zhuangzi, but were likely being used metaphorically\n\nwriting style\nuse of paradox to make points\n\t\"not like the lao tzu where we dont know what was meant by passages, zhuangzi was intentionally confusing\"\nuse of non sequitur\n\t\"lot of this that comes up in the first two chapters\"\n\"zhuangzi takes some ideas from the lao tzu and mutates them in some ways\"\n\tlao tzu had the idea of inaction,\n\tzhuangzi takes this idea further; spontaneity, shouldnt focus on any goal\nmetaphor\n\tex. immortality, walk on water, fly on clouds\n\tidea at the time that sages could have these powers\n\tlikely used by Zhuangzi as metaphor\n\ttaken literally by many readers as well as practitioners of Daoism\n\nno mention of Zhuangzi in the Lao Tzu\n\tconnection is ambiguous\n\napolitical\n\nmany commentaries on this text\nsome sections still unclear to those who study the text\n\"purposefully obfuscated\"\n\n##### discussing the text\nsection 1 - Free and Easy Wandering\nstarts with story of legendary fish and legendary bird\nsmall animals cant fathom these large beasts' lives\n\"When we make an effort and fly up, we can get as far as the elm tree ... how is anyone going to go ninety thousand li to the south!\"\n\"the short-lived cannot come up to the ling-lived\"\n\nHuizi - a Confucianist logician\nmocked in the Zhuangzi\n\nanecdote about hand salve\n\"failure of imagination\"\n\nHuizi anecdote about big tree being useless\nHuizi argues that tree is useless, Zhuangzi argues again a failure of imagination, not understand the nature of the tree\n\"be like the tree and dont have any value for anybody and you wont get in any trouble\"\narguing with Confucian idea about how we need to have value in society\n\nChapter 2\n\"Great understanding is broad and unhurried; little understanding is cramped and busy\"\n\nparadoxes\ndichotomies\n\"words are not just wind\"\n\nmocking logicians\n\"is a white horse a horse?\"\n(read wikipedia page of this idk im not gonna write it all down what it means)\n\n\"so much of whats going on in the Zhuangzi is him mocking/playing with ideas that were floating around at the time\"\n\n#quote\n\"Zhuangzi is all about dunking on people\"\n\nparadoxes, etc. are tongue twisters\n\"there is not yet beginning to be a not yet beginning to be a beginning\"\n\"sounds better in original text\"\nlots of these\n\"meant to shock you, meant to not be followed\"\n\n\"suppose you and I have had an argument. if you have beaten me instead of my beating you, then are you necessarily right and am i necessarily wrong? ...\"\nobjectivity subjectivity\n\n\"Penumbra said to Shadow\"\n\n\"Once Zhuang Zhou dreamt he was a butterfly\"\nmost famous passage\ndistinguishing between being a butterfly dreaming to be Zhuang Zhou and Zhuang Zhou dreaming he is a butterfly\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n\"Cook Ding\" pg 46\nfundamentally understands the way to the extent anyone can\n\"now I go at it by spirit and dont look through my eyes\"\ncraftmanship\nthis cook, not an educated person has a fundamental understanding of the way\nthe way the cook cuts the ox shows the height of skill ^a63d8e\n\nlots of conversation about carpenters/craftmanship\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n\"Carpenter Shi\" pg 59\n\n\nChapter 6\n\npg 86\nstory about Yan Hui and Confucius\n- Confucius' best student that died young\n- see [[2022-09-14 CHIN309]]\n\nputs words in Confucius mouth\n\"this story would never happen in Confucian writing\"\n\n\nonly read a small portion\n\"interesting how distinct the rhetoric is\"\n\n\"This is probably the end of the super weird stuff - no next class Qu Yuan and the Lisao\"\n\nQu Yuan and the Lisao\n- very different worldview from what we've seen so far\n\n\nassignment\nReflection 1 upcoming due 5pm sept. 30\n\n## Reflection 1 rubric\nPlease submit a reflection based on material we have covered through September 30th! Don't feel the need to cover everything. You can simply discuss your favorite piece, something interesting that came up in class, or even discuss how you've encountered the topics at hand outside of class.\n\nYou have a variety of options for format:\n\n300-500 word reflective essay/pastiche of a reading  \n5-10 minute podcast  \n5 minute video  \n5-page comic book\n\nFor written materials, please submit your work as a .docx, .md, or .txt file. Audio files can be .mp3, .wav, or any other common file format (a link to something like SoundCloud is also fine). For video, mp4 or avi files are fine (and alternatively, you can submit a link if the video is hosted on a service like YouTube). If you need to submit visual materials (for a comic book, for instance), .jpg, .png, .tiff, or .pdf files are all fine!\n\nRemember: I will grade these based on coherence, but what this means varies depending on what you submit:\n\nIf you make an argument, do you present adequate evidence in support it?\n\nDoes your pastiche follow the original in an evident way (feel free to provide additional explanation if you think it might not be clear)? \n\nIs it clear what message you are trying to get me to take away, and so on.\n\nPresentation also matters: is the material grammatical, well structured, and so on. Finally, content is important: is there a clear relationship with course materials, does it demonstrate a mastery of them?\n\nPlease  **avoid passive voice** and double check spelling, grammar, and so on.","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.432918334Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-09-19-CSCI243":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-09-19 Monday]] 10:58:20\ndescription:: methods of proof cont\n\nhw is proofs\ndue wednesday 6 questions\ngo to office hours\n\n## Methods of proof\n##### proof by cases (continued)\nneed to construct our proof for each of the possible cases one by one\n\n$(p_1 \\vee p_2 \\vee ... \\vee p_n) \\rightarrow q$\n$\\equiv (p_1 \\rightarrow q) \\wedge (p_2 \\rightarrow q) \\wedge ... \\wedge (p_n \\rightarrow q)$\n\nproving each case one by one\n\nex. show $|x*y| = |x| * |y|$\ncan look at signs of x and y, if they are negative/positive\n1. $x \\geq 0 \\wedge y \\geq 0$\n   $|x*y| = x*y = |x|*|y|$\n2. $x \\geq 0 \\wedge y \u003c 0$\n   $|x*y| = x*(-y) = |x|*|y|$\n3. $x \u003c 0 \\wedge y \\geq 0$\n   $|x*y| = (-x)*y = |x|*|y|$\n4. $x \u003c 0 \\wedge y \u003c 0$\n   $|x*y| = (-x)*(-y) = |x|*|y|$\ndone, weve covered every option\n\nex. show that there are no integer solutions to equation $x^2 + 3y^2 = 8$.\n$x^2 \\leq 8 \\wedge 3y^2 \\leq 8$\nsomething soemthing we're skipping this one its in the lecture notes\n\n\n##### existence proof\nto prove there exists an object of certain type, we can simply construct one;

Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.\"\n-w3 schools\n\nAbility to select different methods of same name according to type of object\n\nok so basically when methods with the same name are able to do different things depending on the class of object\n\n```Java\nclass Animal {\n  public void animalSound() {\n    System.out.println(\"The animal makes a sound\");\n  }\n}\n\nclass Pig extends Animal {\n  public void animalSound() {\n    System.out.println(\"The pig says: wee wee\");\n  }\n}\n\nclass Dog extends Animal {\n  public void animalSound() {\n    System.out.println(\"The dog says: bow wow\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\nhere we can call animalSound() for all of these classes and it works and does their own things\n\nnext is inheritance\n\n## Inheritance\ncode sharing\navoiding redundancy\nif code is shared, it is used more often\nif code is used more often, there is more opportunity to find mistakes in it and fix them\n\ninclusion hierarchy\ninheritance useful as an ideology for managing large code bases\n\n![[Pasted image 20220920112716.png]]\n\ninheritance hierarchy\n![[Pasted image 20220920112843.png]]\n\n\"with inheritance you get things for free, you can add, you can adjust, but you dont take away\"\nyou get base methods, you can adjust them, you can add new methods, the only thing you cant do is remove methods/make them private/etc\n\nquite powerful\nif we wanted to run a method like getSalary on all employees, if the employees are paid by the hour or have a salary or are interns, doesn't matter, they all have a base version of this getSalary method and if they have a special case to calculate salary the method can be overridden and changed\n\n##### SOLID principles in object oriented design\nS - Single Responsibility principle\n- when you design classes it is recommended to give every class **just one responsibility**\n- classes are identifiable; easy to understand their function/responsibility when each class has only one\n- dividing complexity\n- concerns: effect of changes, complexity of a class, class reuse\n\nO - Open/Closed principle\n- software entities should be open for extension, closed for modification\n- \"as long as it works dont touch it\"\n- open for extension - adding on functionality\n- closed for modification - the core part (that works already) is not touched\n\nL - Liskov's Substitution principle\n\nI - Interface Segregation principle\n- many client-specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface\n- better to have multiple interfaces for special needs than one large interface\n- \"the bigger it is the harder it is to support all of it\"\n- have several, dedicated, smaller, specific-purpose interfaces\n\nD - Dependency Inversion principle\n- Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions\n- \"high-level modules/implementations should not depend on lower level modules/implementations. If that is the case — that our high-level modules depend on lower level modules means that there is an inversion of dependencies! Hence the name of the principle.\"\n- \"It protects us from a ripple effect from changes inside low level modules.\"\n- how do we implement this principle specifically? i dont get it\n\n##### Invoking superclass methods\ncant access private fields of a superclass\n- gives more control of how subclasses interact\n\nwhen accessing private fields, normally would use a get method\nbe careful when doing this in subclasses\n\n```Java\npublic double getSalary()\n{\n\treturn getSalary() + bonus; // ERROR--recursive call\n}\n```\n\nif the Employee class has a getSalary function, and the salary field is private, then the Manager class could do something like the above, calling a get method to access the field. however this creates a loop\n\nto avoid this use the `super` keyword\n```Java\npublic double getSalary()\n{\n\treturn super.getSalary() + bonus;\n}\n```\nsuper climbs up one level in the hierarchy\nin this case, it will run Employee's version of getSalary, and not recursively call Manager's version of getSalary.\n\n\n##### using super in subclass constructor\nwhen we construct a subclass, we may want to use the superclass's constructor, and then add to it.\n\nwe can do this by calling super() in the first line of the subclass's constructor\n```Java\npublic Manager(String aName)\n{\n\tsuper(aName); // calls superclass constructor\n\tbonus = 0;\n}\n```\nmust be the first line\nparameters can be passed through\nafter calling super, can continue initialization of subclass' other stuff\n\n\n##### precondition\n\"what circumstances under which you perform well\"\ntheres also postcondition\ni dont really get it but seems useful\nshould look into more later\n```Java\npublic class Employee\n{\n\t/**\n\tSets the employee salary to a given value.\n\t@param aSalary the new salary\n\t@precondition aSalary \u003e 0\n\t*/\n\tpublic void setSalary(double aSalary) { \n\t\t... \n\t}\n} \n```\nis it an actual technical thing or a good practice thing\n\n\n\n\n##### project 1 reflection\npower is down so we cant do anything but we were gonna review an example project 1 submission\n\ncode review - an important skill\ncode readability is important\n\nreflection on mine\n- i shouldve used another private method for movement instead of copy pasting 4 times for each direction\n\t- still readable, but wouldve been better and i can think of a way to do it\n- shouldve looked more into equals and hashCode\n\t- still not really sure how hashCode works, not sure equals was working right because new tiles still got added even if a move was made that didnt change the board\n- couldve written longer comments outside of each method instead of dispersed comments throughout each method\n\t- or both really","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.432918334Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-09-20-JAPN208":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-09-20 Tuesday]] 13:54:04\ndescription:: discussing [[Fukuzawa's Autobiography]] \n\npaper 1 due friday by the end of the day\nin text citation is fine (name, pg)\nany citation method is fine\ncan use in text citation for other assignments as well\n\nreading today is from Fukuzawa Yukichi's autobiography\n\n## [[Fukuzawa's Autobiography]]\n##### initial remarks\nmuch more positive than Bird's adventure to Japan\nvery interesting, gripping detail\nhe describes political conflicts in japan\neasier vocabulary\n- translation done not too long ago\n- more difficult to read in original japanese\nbecame more outspoken against anti foreign policy\n\n##### presenters\ntakes a lot of notice of the cultural differences\nhow wealth is different in san francisco - displayed differently\ntakes note of large scale of things in europe - big hotels\nobjective of travel was looking at industry and technological advancement in these countries, he does not focus his notes on that, focuses on culture instead\nasks people about how things work\nwe see his sensibilities arise\n- hierarchical structures and power dynamics\n\t- notices hierarchy not as important in the US ex. george washingtons family\n- pride\n\t- japan doesnt want help\n\t- he doesnt support japans anti foreign policies but still shows pride himself\nhe is a contact zone\ninitiates dictionaries shipped to japan, he picks up new education practices and ideas\nfukuzawa highlights internal strife of japan, bird does not talk about politics\n- rise of militarism\n- anti foreign policy\n- power dynamics\n- internal warring\n\ncomparison to isabella bird's writing\nauthors are both \"pioneers\" as first points of contact\ndifference in why they go\n- the allure of going to japan\n- vs studying western culture/technology\nthey both realize how different this new place is\n- fukuzawa tries to learn more\n- bird does not care to learn more, wants to be accomodated\nboth are appreciative of how people accomodate them\nfukuzawa wants to learn english, bird does not try to learn any japanese\nfukuzawa seemed to enjoy the trip more, even though his trip was not for the purpose of enjoyment\nboth travellers are like moving contact zones, first japanese man/european woman to travel to europe/japan, first contact for many of the people from these countries\n\njapan was just starting to open up to western influence/being forced to open up\nfukuzawa doesnt care much for seeing the economic/scientific achievements of the west, because he'd read about them already\nhe wanted to learn about the culture\nhe was embarrassed by his lack of cultural knowledge\ndidnt see a lot of the US, only saw big cities, only accompanied by a govt watcher\ndidnt see slavery, or any life outside of cities\ndiscouraged by \"the foolish pride of japanese people\"\nwasnt dismissive toward (most) cultural difference, more open minded than bird\nseveral examples of contact zones\ntell us a lot about the state of international relations during its time\n- western powers were comfortable pushing around smaller countries like japan\n- japan was struggling to keep up\n\n##### questions to consider when reading\nWhat did Fukuzawa see in the US and Europe?

calling t.interrupt() doesnt actually interrupt t; just sets a flag\n   - effect depends on thread program code\n   - supposed behavior\n\t   - interrupted thread must sense interruption `boolean isInterrupted()`\n\t   - and exit its run method\n   - interrupted thread has a chance to clean up\n\n##### sensing interruptions\noption 1\n- thread could occasionally call `Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()`\n\noption 2\n- thread could occasionally `sleep()`, or `wait()`\n- both methods throw InterruptedException when thread interrupted\n- ... and then the interruption status is cleared\n\noption 2 is more robust\n- sleep occasionally, catch exception and react to interruption\n- **allows for clear separation of code**\n\nrecommendation\n- terminate run when sensing interruption (common reaction)\n- use variant 2\n\t- locate all code for cleaning up in `catch/finally` clause\n\t- enhance with variant 1 for lengthy methods without exceptions\n\t- make check with `isInterrupted throw InterruptedException`\n\n```Java\npublic class MyRunnable implements Runnable\n{\n\tpublic void run()\n\t{\n\t\ttry\n\t\t{\n\t\t\twhile (...)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t// do work\n\t\t\t\tThread.sleep(...);\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\tcatch (InterruptedException e)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t// clean up\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n🏃‍♂️, 😴, ⏰\n\n##### summary\ncreate threads\nassign work to a thread\nterminate a thread\nnext:\ncommunicate data between threads\n\trace condition\n\tlocks and synchronized method calls\n\n\n[[M2L3_MultiThreading_part2.key.pdf]]\n## Intro to Multithreading - Part 2\ntheres example stuff im not gonna write it all out\n\ntypical situation in compositional approaches\n- 1st step: get the components\n\t- define threads, get them running, make them terminate\n- 2nd step: combine components to overall system\n  Here: communication among threads?\n\t- in principle: simple, threads communicate via shared memory, ie objects\n\t- eg. explicitly via an object \"messageQueue\"\n\t- eg. implicitly via object that hold data and are accessed by several threads (not necessarily aware of one another)\n\t- in practice: **shared data must be handled with care!**\n\nexample: visitors to a garden counted at 2 turnstiles\nthreads A and B: read counter, increment value, update counter, do 20 times\n```Java\nfor (i = 0 ; i \u003c 20 ; i++)\n{\n\tx = counter ; x++ ; counter = x ;\n}\n```\nboth threads communicate via shared counter\nexpect result of counter = 40\ndoes it work\n- often, but there is no quarantee\n- occasionally see results like 32, 37, 39...\n\n##### race condition\nA race condition occurs if **the effect of multiple threads on shared data depends on the order in which threads are scheduled**.\n- obviously a bad thing\n\t- common requirement - we want deterministic programs that reliably produce same correct output for same input\n\t- additional difficulty - detection of race condition, may be difficult to reproduce\n\t- essentially a nightmare for debugging and testing\n- so we need\n\t- a design strategy to avoid race conditions.\n\t- a technical, language mean that helps us programming a solution\n\t\t- (what does that mean am i having a stroke)\n\n##### solution to race conditions\n- access to shared objects requires protection\n\t- mutual exclusion:\n\t\t- thread/process can access object or enter a critical code section **only one at a time**\n\t\t- generalization; at most $n$ threads/processes, common: $n$ reader, 1 writer\n- key issue\n\t- thread can do that computation without being disturbed, without interference from others\n- design strategy\n\t- check all classes, objects with read/write access to several threads\n\t- use encapsulation and restrict access\n- in java\n\t- synchronize access to shared objects to have at most $n$ threads access data\n\t- means to describe that: **Locks**\n\t- important - concept should avoid busy waiting (which is the case here)!\n\n##### object locks\n- each object in Java has a lock\n- lock activated with keyword \"`synchronized`\"\n- calling a synchronized method - acquires lock of implicit parameter\n- leaving the synchronized method - releases lock\n- easier than explicit Lock objects - but granularity fixed to method calls!\n```Java\n{\n\tpublic synchronized void add(E newValue) { . . . }\n\tpublic synchronized E remove() { . . . }\n\t. . .\n}\n```\n\n##### summary\ncreate threads\nassign work to a thread\nterminate a thread\ncommunicate data between threads\n\tshared memory, shared objects\n\trace condition\n\tlocks and synchronized method calls\n\n##### challenges in testing a multithreaded class\nsee last slide i dont wanna write it out\n\n##### for project 2\nasked to test code that runs in background thread\ntypically with testing create object, perform operations, see if it checks out\nbackground threads complicate this, test is running faster than background thread\n- our maze building algorithm operates on a background thread\n- test code executes on a different thread\nhave to use order() to order a maze\nwe have method waitTillDelivered() for waiting during testing\nuhh idk im not following anymore look at MazeFactory.java for fully implemented class\n\"challenge is to implement a not so easy algorithm, making it fit in isnt as hard\" (we can see the other two algorithms already implemented)\n\"challenge is to write meaningful tests cases\"\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.432918334Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-09-22-JAPN208":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-09-22 Thursday]] 13:54:09\ndescription:: Traveling Empire, [[Travels in Manchuria and Mongolia]]\n\nessay 1 due tmr\n\"i wont check until saturday morning so 1am 2am is fine\"\nlol\n\"its better to paraphrase in your own words instead of using a direct quotation\"\n\nreading for tuesday\nYosano Akiko, [[Travels in Manchuria and Mongolia]]\nread to page 64\nthink about the context of japanese colonialism\n\nnews!\nprime minister of japan just said today that travel restrictions are being lifted starting october\n\n## Traveling Empire I\nCultural meanings of travel in relation to empire building\n\nYosano Akiko\nvery famous poet\nher travels funded by South Manchurian Railway, big Manchurian company, company recieved its funding in part from Japanese govt\n\n##### Empire of Japan's Conquests\nRyukyu Kingdom \n- incorporated as Okinawa prefecture, 1879\n- (new meiji govt incorporated hokkaido around this time as well)\n- ryukyu was an independent kingdom, small island south of japan\n- one of japans first attempts at empire building\n\nTaiwan \n- from Qing Empire\n- Shimonoseki Treaty, 1895\n- was part of japan for half a century\n\nManchuria\n- colonization started early 20th century\n- Kwantung Leased Territory (Dalian)\n- Southern Sakhalin from Russia -

represents, not able to move between these nodes\ngenerating a maze = creating a spanning tree\n\nMaze generation seen as a graph problem\n- positions are the set of nodes V\n- edges are possible

carry a numerical weight or cost\n\nGraph concepts\n- reachability\n\t- path from node v to w\n- minimal spanning tree\n\t- subset of edges such that all vertices are connected, ie for all nodes v and w there exists a path from v to w and vice versa\n\t- minimal: sum of weights is minimal\n\t- typical assumption: weights are unique\n\n##### How to generate a Minimal Spanning Tree (MST)?\nObservation\n- if you have n already connected components which are trees and m left over edges connecting these (ie for each edge their end nodes are in different components), then you need to select n-1 out of m edges\n- you can work towards an MST by adding one minimum weight (cost) edge connecting 2 components that are separate so far. this reduces the problem to n-1 trees and at most m-1 left over edges\n\nfor MST:\n- Select cheapest option at hand (locally), pick the cheapest edge\n- Never connect nodes that are in the same component\n\t- as they are already connected\n\nvariants of this idea\n- Prim\n\t- \"grow a single tree\"\n\t- select your favorite component and grow it by adding edges and thus nodes to it\n\t- so: iterate over subset of edges expanding a single component\n- Kruskal\n\t- \"grow a forest by growing one tree each step\"\n\t- select the cheapest left over edge and connect the components\n\t- so: iterate over edges merging any 2 components\n- Boruvka\n\t- \"grow a forest by growing each tree each step\"\n\t- select the cheapest edge for each component and connect the components.\n\t- so: iterate over components and for each merge it with one adjacent component by selecting the cheapest edge\n\n##### How do unique edge weights prevent cycles?\nunique edge weights are useful because they prevent cycles/loops\nhow they do it:\n- pick the cheapest edge leacing the component\n- say it leads to B, weight 10\n- only chance for B to have another edge\n\t- weight \u003c 10\n\t- since weights are unique, there are no equal weights, so there is no confusion on which one is the cheapest\n- edges are undirected, so could at most go back one\n\nbest way to learn new algorithms is to draw up examples and solve them using the algorithm\n\nthe algorithm\ninit\nfind cheapest edge for each component\ncheck termination\n\n##### Trees, Forests, and Mazes\nHow to generate a maze?\n- think of a set of possible positions V in a space\n- need a path from any position x to any other position y\n- do not want too many paths or maze gets boring...\n\npoint of view\n- think of walls between all positions V\n- each node is isolated and in its own set\n- if we remove a wall, we merge the sets the neighboring nodes belong to\n- if we remove neough walls such that all nodes belong to one set, we have a maze where all positions can be reached from another\n\nso\n- removing a wall is the same as adding an edge to a graph\n- want a random maze - pick random, but unique, weights\n\n\nmoving on to a third slideshow for some

Programming Process in his book in Chapter II.9 (Code Complete). The key idea is to do this in 2 steps: 1) use comments in a Java class to write up the procedure on how to solve a problem in plain English, but structure your steps into methods; 2) once your thought process is complete and you worked it all out, translate your comments into code. This section elaborates this concept in further detail.\n\ni dont think im gonna write out a lot for this one\n\nhigh-level method design contians\n- the responsibility/purpose of the routine\n- the information the routine will hide\n- inputs to the routine\n- outputs from the routine\n- preconditions that are guaranteed to be true before the routine is called\n- postconditions that the routine guarantees will be true before it passes control back to the caller\n\nlow-level method design\n- key idea: separate detailed design from coding\n- design\n\t- write up how the method works in pseudocode\n\t- think it through, do not forget cases, clarify I/O\n\t- does not interfere with coding issues\n- once written, write code for it\n- pseudocode $\\rightarrow$ comments, no need for more\n- in other words: \"write comments first!\"\n\non writing pseudocode\n- makes reviews/adjustment easier\n- supports the idea of iterative refinement\n- makes changes easier (before coding)\n- minimizes commenting effort\n- easier to maintain than other forms of design documentation\n\n##### Pseudocode Programming Process PPP\nStarting point: Given high-level design\nStep 1: Check prerequisites (job is well-defined, required)\nStep 2: Name the routine\n- \"if you cant name the routine then you dont understand it enough\"\nStep 3: Decide how to test the routine\nStep 4: Check for existing solutions (reuse code, ideas)\nStep 5: Consider error handling\nStep 6: Consider efficiency (no premature optimization)\nStep 7: Check for existing data types, algorithms\nStep 8: Think about the data (data types, what to store)\nStep 9: Write/refine description in pseudocode\nStep 10: Check/review pseudocode\n- yourself, ask someone else\n- make sure everything is clear to you before you start coding\nIterate: try a few ideas and keep the best!\n\n![[Pasted image 20220927121234.png]]\nfrom Code Complete\n\nthere's also a good checklist in the slides im not gonna write it out\n\n\"dont fall in love with your first idea\"\n\nend of class","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.432918334Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-09-27-JAPN208":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-09-27 Tuesday]] 13:56:35\ndescription:: discussing [[Travels in Manchuria and Mongolia]]\n\nreading for today was yosano akiko [[Travels in Manchuria and Mongolia]]\ni did not read much of it\n\npeoples initila thoughts\n- transitioned from how nice and beautiful scenery was, by the end was all about war and japanese occupation\n- here, chinese resent japanese occupation, whereas before, japan resented european occupation\n- can tell author was a poet and translator, focuses on parallels between japanese and chinese language, culture\n- saw a lot of different places, started in big cities, saw more rural areas as moved north\n\ncouple more important historical context pieces we didnt talk about last time\n\nManchuria and China circa 1928\n- military tension rising, japan didnt fully control manchuria yet\n- transitional period\n\nbefore this point\n- Kwantung Leased Territory 1905 -

Is she a colonizer?\n\t- she's silently corroborating\n\t- she recognizes the issue, but sees it more as a hassle to get around\n\t- elephant in the room\n\t- she doesnt write about it much\n\t- she seems to view herself as superior\n\t- she is benefiting from the system\n\t\t- her presence itself, brought there on a trip paid for by a company, avoiding areas of high tension\n\t\t- able to go to hotels, hot springs, where the colonialism is not as much of a visible problem\n\t\t- the railway is staffed entirely by japanese\n\t\t- she was safer traveling through manchuria than others\n\t\t- is benefiting from this book\n\t\t- benefiting from seeing culture, gained inspiration for her work, wrote poems about nature and history she saw\n\t\t\t- benefited intellectually\n\t\t- at the fundamental level her desire to travel to manchuria itself was possibly shaped by colonialism\n\t\t\t- couldnt have imagined going to manchuria if not for japanese presence there\n\t- was she aware of what japan was doing in manchuria?\n\t\t- probably yes\n\t\t- seems to be fully aware based on parts of her writing\n\t\t- wants to ignore it\n\t\t- wont let it ruin her trip!\n\t\t- how does she reconcile this tension?\n\t\t- with her trip since it was funded and safe, her experience was very different than someone else traveling through manchuria without the same resources\n\t\t- easier for her to only talk about the good things and brush over the other stuff\n- How can we apply the concept of \"contact zone\"?\n\t- examples of contact zones\n\t\t- she notes in a town that there are many buddhist and daoist temples next to each other\n\t\t- the japanese businesses in manchuria\n\t\t- construction of tourist economy in manchuria\n\t\t- making japanese food/products to attract business\n\t- example of anti conquest\n\t\t- she was separating herself from the colonizing\n\t\t- she avoids the colonialism issue for the most part, but still feels superior\n\t\t- the railway company, has a huge amount of control, but says theyre just doing it for tourism\n\nmany people that travelled this way (with varying levels of resources/privilege)\nnext class moving on to next module, **Migration**\n\ndescribing in one word\n- ironic; we just saw similar travel into japan, now japan is doing it to other countries","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.432918334Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-09-28-CHIN309":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-09-28 Wednesday]] 17:01:49\ndescription:: talking about [[Book of Han]]\n\nlast time talked about records of the grand historian\nnow talking about similar records of history\ntalked about the annals of Kao-Tsu last time\n\nfor reflection feel free to compare and contrast readings, make connections, do a deep dive on one reading, \"intentionally flexible\"\n\n##### Official Histories\nGeneral bibliographic classification\nHistories vetted by imperial authorities\nor\nThe 24 dynastic histories\nfrom book of the han all the way through 20th century\n\nvery powerful, important thing to make\nmade by highly skilled scholars, used archives\ncompiled for the last dynasty by the new dynasty\nshows they have the power as a new dynasty to compile these texts\n\nEarly history - Han (to 2nd century BC)\n1.

narrative\nfiction and narrative storytelling\n\njumping forward a little\nout of han dynasty and into next period, The Six Dynasties\n\n##### The Six Dynasties and Utopia\nThe Six Dynasties 220-589\nincludes a lot of different political entities over these 400+ years, gets lumped together as a time of literary development\n\n- Three Kingdoms 220-280\n\t- Wei vs Wu vs Shu\n- Jin Dynasty 265-420\n\t- lots of argument about mandate of heaven\n- Northern and Southern Dynasties 420-589\n\t- very tumultuous time, these empires didnt last very long\n\t- Liu Song \n\t- Southern Qi\n\t- Liang\n\t- Chen\n\n##### Tao Yuanming aka Tao Qian 365-427\ndescended from important officials\nserved as an official\nconstantly longed for the simple life\nwanted to return to farming\nok stardew\nacted as an official in 415 for only 3 months before returning to solitude\nadmired for sticking to his ideals\nrejects the idea that one has to devote their life to the govt\n\n##### Poems After Drinking Wine (No. 5)\nfirst poem pg 77 in columbia reader\npoems that romanticize drinking\n\"celebrate drinking as a way of collegiately getting along with friends\"\n\n\tI built my hut beside a traveled road\n\tYet hear no noise of passing carts and horses.\n\nmetaphorical, living without being distracted by whats around you\n\"mind detached\"\ndont need to move out into the mountains to become detached, need to detach your mind\nDaoist idea, stepping away from the world\n\nwhat do you think of this poem?\n- finding peace internally not externally\n- how well does the translation get the original ideas across\n- similar to whitman poems\n- style makes it seem he's talking directly to the reader (in translation at least)\n- poem structure not so rigid\n\t- still structured, in original, 5 character couplets, rhyming\n\t- \"form not changing significantly, subject is changing\"\n\t- doesnt diverge much from literary norms at the time\n- talking about nature, romanticizing nature, romanticizing being alone\n- equating nature with peacefulness\n\t- \"not making nature seem violent\" or dangeroud\n\t- daoist idea of nature being dangerous, need to get out of its way\n\nhas a lot of poems with a similar flavor\n\n##### On Reading *The Mountains and Seas Classic*\nsecond poem\npg 79\n\n*The Mountains and Seas Classic*\n- presented as a geography, outside of china, fantastical countries\n- early han dynasty maybe earlier\n\nin the poem, a farmer\nbeyond the reach of officialdom\n\n\tThis out-of-the-way lane has no deep-worn ruts\n\tAnd tends to turn my friends' carts away.\n\nromanticizing solitude\nidyllic weather, no one around\n\n\tI skip through the *Story of King Mu*\n\tAnd view the pictures in the *Mountains and Seas Classic*\n\tA glance encompasses the ends of the universe --\n\tWhere is there any joy, if not in these?\n\nsitting back and reading\n\"yeah this is awesome\"\n\nthoughts?\n- calm and idyllic, political atmosphere must be better, or there is a desire to get away from politics\n- contrasts from how it would be to serve as an official\n- no explicit lesson, just vibing\n- Stardew Valley evokes similar feelings\n- observant of nature\n\nTao Qian is known for this aloofness\n\n##### The Return\nthird poem\npg 235\n\nan essay with a poem appended to it\none can be known through their poetry\npoems further express the emotion behind the writing\n\nhere, Tao Qian describing his life and how it is\npoor, thought of becoming a magistrate, didnt wanna\nhad connections, and was offered a job, didnt wanna go\ntook the job, after a month or two, says this isnt for me\nstayed in the position because it was comfortable\nrealized he was compromising his principles, gives up the job\nthen a poem\ncould see the prose as a preface to the poem\n\n\tMy field and garden will be overgrown with weeds --\n\tI must go back.\n\nhis farm hasnt been cared for while he was out working, he wants to return\nhe gets back and is happy\nautobiographical\nrather than expressing a single moment in time, expressing a series of ideals\n\nthoughts?\n- do you see the same voice behind this poem as the others?\n\t- has a more poetic tone, this one is more autobiographical, like a diary\n- flow of consciousnees rather than a structured poem\n- it feels like he's older in this poem\n- like he's at the end of his life, at peace\n\t- this is a choice i made and im content with it\n\n\nthese poems are not the first thing people think of when they think of Tao Qian, they think of the next poem\none of the most famous of these kinds of these poems, take on utopia\n\n##### The Peach Blossom Spring\nfourth poem\npg 364\nstarts with prose again, followed by a poem\n\na fisherman stumbling across a utopia\noften where you hear these stories about finding utopia, it's always stumbling in, never found when trying actively to find it\ndaoist idea?\n\nin the utopia\nnice things\ngrowing crops\nlivestock\nsense of abundance, activity\npeople enjoying things\n\nthey tell the man that their ancestors had fled the disorders of the Ch'in dynasty (Qin in modern pinyin)\n~600 years have passed\nlost all contact about the outside world\nexcited listening to the fisherman explain what has happened in history since then, the dynasties that have passed\nidea that utopia is focused on how people acted in the past\n\"living in accordance with the Dao, just hanging out\"\n\nfisherman leaves and tells the magistrate about it, people go looking for it, cant find it\n\n\"one of the fascinating things about this piece is you have this prose piece, then you have a poem following that lays out what happened and moralizes it\"\nfollowed by a poem\n\n\tAlthough they had no calendar to tell,\n\tThe four seasons still filled out a year.\n\nagainst the idea of the calendar, sacred at the time, emperor maintained the calendar, everyone followed the calendar, etc\nthey didnt need a calendar, they knew when each season came as the weather changed\nnature knows, we dont need to stress about it\nvery daoist idea\n\n\tJoyous in their ample happiness,\n\tThey had no need of clever contrivance.\n\nprobably his most famous poem\n\nthoughts?\n- interesting social commentary at the time\n- what inspires someone to write about utopia like this?\n- not necessarily advocating for daoism specifically, but describing results of a community that ascribes to it\n- what do you think of the poem as an encapsulation of the prose's story?\n\n\nnow lets talk about Xie Lingyun\n\n##### Xie Lingyun 385-433\n\"kind of a controversial figure, poems are difficult to read\"\nhe was a bhuddist\nhad difficult struggles politically\non the wrong side of imperial opinion\nserved in govt for 20 years\nfound himself on losing side of succession battle, exiled to some local job, resigned, moved to family estate, spent a lot of time writing in the mountains\ncouldnt keep his opinions to himself, banished further, tried to start a rebellion, failed, banished further, eventually executed\nconsidered the first landscape poet\n\n\"likes to show off his vocabulary, some of his poems are long lists of nouns\"\n\n\n##### On My Way from South Mountain to North Mountain, I Glance at the Scenery from the Lake\npg 80 in columbia reader\n\nmany of his poems set from a viewpoint of transit\na journey\nhe's walking here\n\njuxtaposition of things that are close and things that are far\nex. leaning against lush pines as he turns his eyes upon distant sandbars\n\npoem is really just describing the nature around him\ndoesnt have a conflict, resolution, moral, just very descriptive\n\nthought?\n- descriptive\n- less focus on the self\n\t- how do i fit into nature vs. the person is a vessel, observer\n\t- not living in nature like Tao Qian\n\t- \"he was quite wealthy, his family lands were pretty extensive\"\n\t- mf was just walking around his backyard\n\t- important to realize, how nature is described, and how people fit in it\n\n\nmore poems we didnt have as readings but still interesting\n\n##### I've Put in Gardens South of the Fields\n\"idea one almost has to carve out the beauty of nature to make it ideal\"\nlike a landscaped garden, lot of effort to show nature while limiting the wild stuff\n\nfeng shui\n- how old is feng shui? super old\n\n\n##### Dwelling in the Mountains\none of the poems thats mostly just nouns\nseries of poems called dwelling in the mountains, in poem 24\ntrout perch trent red eye sturgeon carp mandarin fish flying fish bass...........\njust keeps listing types of fish he sees\n\nwhat do you make of this style of poetry?\n- red fish blue fish\n- starts with listing, then describes what they were doing\n\nthis style is common for him, not all as egregious\n\nnext poem is worse though\nthere are birds like swan esprey thrush turkey ducks pheasants seabirds northern birds ................\nsays a bunch more that i dont even know\nand lists a bunch of mammals\n\nnot much interstitial commentary, just talking about wildlife\n\nany other thoughts?\n- short and sweet just descriptive not much fluff\n- showing off his erudition\n- expressing the grandeur of the land he's in\n- many of the poems give off a minimalistic feeling, maybe because of the translation\n- is this escapism?\n-

\"This is going to be fun\" it isn't\n- How does it feel to work on coding assignments?\n\nFun in software dev\n- This is the hard way\n\t- define success as \"my program is fully implemented and works correctly!\"\n- This is an alternative\n\t- create a sequence of meaningful steps towards ultimate goal\n\t- check a box when you complete a step\n\t- ideally: at the end of the day, stop after completing a step, do not start another one and then leave in between\n\nAn analogy\n- jigsaw puzzles\n- whats the fun in this?\n- the last moment when the puzzle is done, or the process?\n- over 100 puzzle pieces, how would you graph the fun?\n\nWhat do former CS students say who work in tech\n- \"There is always something new to learn in my job\"\n- \"I learn something new every week\"\n- \"One thing I know for sure: I'll figure it out\"\n- \"If I stop learning in my job, I move on and change teams or employers\"\n- You never stop seeing new concepts\n\n[[CS301_M2L3c_TestingMcConnellTricks_PresentationSlides.pdf]]\n## Steve McConnell's Bag of Testing Tricks\n[[Code Complete]]\nInput\n- Incomplete testing\n\t- not all inputs can be tested, need to make choices\n\t- corner cases\n\t- pick inputs that differ\n\t- thing of input as a space of possible things, cut it up\n- This idea shows up in various ways\n\t- input partitioning\n\t- picking representatives across equivalence classes\n\t- error guessing\n- We'll focus on testing a single method\n\nStructured Basis Testing\n- related: McCabe's cyclomatic complexity\n- Calculate lower bound for number of paths (execution paths)\n\t- More possible paths, more complexity\n\t- 1 Start with 1 for straight path through method\n\t- 2 Add 1 for each of the following; if, while, repeat, for, and, or, etc\n\t\t- places where code diverges into different paths\n\t- 3 Add 1 for each case in a switch statement\n\t\t- default case counted with straight path\n- Create set of tests to cover calculated set of paths\n\t- create a test per path\n\t- could be like a lot\n\t- what if it has like 27 paths?\n\t\t- sus\n\t\t- may be a sign to rewrite to reduce complexity\n\nData Flow Testing\n- Data can exist in one of 3 states\n\t- defined = data initialized but not used yet\n\t- used = data has been used for computation\n\t- killed = data was once defined but is undefined now\n- and to describe enter-exit method calls\n\t- entered = control enters a method, initialized variable\n\t- exited = control exits a method, assigned a return value\n- Key idea\n\t- normal operation = defined -\u003e used -\u003e killed\n\t- other sequences (combinations) are suspicious works for code reviewing and testing\n\nSuspicious combinations\n- defined and then\n\t- defined: variable should not be set twice\n\t- exited or killed: variable is defined but not used\n- entered and then\n\t- used or killed: variable needs to be defined beforehand\n- killed and then\n\t- killed: variable should be not killed twice\n\t- used: logical error, accessing freed memory\n- used and then\n\t- defined: variable needs to be defined beforehand\nthis is good stuff\n- Check suspicious combinations **before** testing\n- Data flow testing\n\t- test all defined-used pairs\n\t- weaker variant: all definitions\n- How to do this\n\t- list all defined-used pairs for a method\n\t- for each def-use pair that is not covered yet\n\t\t- create additional test cases\n\nSystematic Partition Testing\n- Useful when looking at code from outside\n- Partition parameter/value ranges into groups that would have the same effect\n- For each group create only one test case with a representative value chose from the equivalence set\n- can use this to think about what we're doing in the process of testing\n\n![[Pasted image 20221004112635.png]]\nshows fringe cases in the input\n\nError Guessing\n- Based on past experience, tester guesses what cases the implementation may not handle correctly\n- Common errors\n- Common pitfalls\n- Edge cases, boundary values\n- Corner cases, exception handling\n\nBoundary Analysis\n- Check cases around limits and extreme cases\n- Ex Check for off by one errors\n\t- check cases with max-1, max, and max+1\n- Ex Combinations of extreme values\n\t- what if all factors in a product are large; negative; zero\n\t- what if all strings puched into a data structure are extremely long\n\nClasses of Bad Data\n- Typical bad-data test cases include\n\t- too little data or no data\n\t- too much data\n\t- wrong kind of data or invalid data\n\t- wrong size of data\n\t- uninitialized data\n\nClasses of Good Data\n- Typical good-data test cases include\n\t- nominal cases--middle of the road, expected values\n\t- minimum normal configuration\n\t- maximum normal configuration\n\t- compatibility with old data\n- Structured basis testing typically covers good data cases\n\nMore tricks\n- Use test cases that make hand checks convenient\n\t- values like 10,000 are easier to hand check than like 12094, and are usually just as good\n- Goes back to oracle problem\n\t- given a test case, what is the correct answer?\n\t- how can you reliably get that answer?\n\nFinal check list on test cases from Steve McConnell\n1. Does each requirement that applies to the class or routine have its own test case?\n2. Does each element from the design that applies to the class or routine have its own test case?\n3. Has each line of code been tested with at least one test case? Has this been verified by computing the minimum number of tests necessary to exercise each line of code?\n4. Have all defined-used data-flow paths been tested with at least one test case?\n5. Has the code been checked for data-flow patterns that are unlikely to be correct, such as defined-defined, defined-exited, and defined-killed? \n6. Has a list of common errors been used to write test cases to detect errors that have occurred frequently in the past? \n7. Have all simple boundaries been tested: maximum, minimum, and off-by-one boundaries? \n8. Have compound boundaries been tested—that is, combinations of input data that might result in a computed variable that's too small or too large?\n9. Do test cases check for the wrong kind of data—for example, a negative number of employees in a payroll program? \n10. Are representative, middle-of-the-road values tested? \n11. Is the minimum normal configuration tested? \n12. Is the maximum normal configuration tested? \n13. Is compatibility with old data tested? And are old hardware, old versions of the operating system, and interfaces with old versions of other software tested? \n14. Do the test cases make hand-checks easy?\nuhh ok\n\nSummary\n- Structured basis testing\n- Data flow testing\n- Input partitioning\n- Error guessing, the usual suspects:\n\t- boundary analysis\n\t- classes of good data\n\t- classes of bad data\n\t- complex methods\n- remember: errors are not distributed uniformly!\n\n\n[[CS301_M2L3e_TestingOracle_PresentationSlides.pdf]]\nnot taking very thorough notes on this one so just look at presentation\n## An Oracle for Testing\nThe Oracle Problem\n- Key question\n\t- How do we decide if the observed program behavior is correct?\n- Besides obvious cases where it's easy to tell when code failed, like when it crashes, how do we know beyond that that it is doing the right thing\n- Up to us to decide what the code is supposed to do\n\t- How do we decide if the answer is not trivial?\n\nObservation 1: We pick the question\n- some questions may be easier than others\n- for certain questions, answer feasible with manual calculations or with analytical formulas that are known and tracable\n\t- exact answer, upper/lower bound\n\nObservation 2: Redundancy in Algorithms\n- often many algorithms known to solve a problem\n- start with a naive version that is straightforward\n- use simple algorithm as oracle for production version\n\nObservation 3: There is a lot of code out there\n- use existing code as an oracle\n- other dedicated frameworks, different programming environment, inefficient but readily available data structures\n\nObservation 4: Consistency\n- consistency is weaker than correctness but still useful\n- ...\n\nObservation 5: Bounds and necessary conditions\n- bounds give limits to correct reults\n- bounds help identify clear error cases\n- in general: necessary conditions\n\t- \"$\\rightarrow$\" weaker than \"$\\leftrightarrow$\" but easier to obtain and implement\n\t- idk what this means\n\nSummary\n- Oracle requires some kind of redundant solution for specific test questions\n\t- looking for other sources, other code, etc. as a second, alternate implementation\n- Outcome of Oracle needs to be documented in test case\n\t- documentation documentation\n- Test code must be simple enough such that it need no testing on its own\n\t- vicious cycle\n- There should be no magic involved!\n- Transparency is important for credibility\n\t- how did you get the correct answer and why is it correct\n\n\nMy god another slideshow\n\n[[CS301_M2L3f_TestingCoverage_PresetantionSlides.pdf]]\n## Coverage Criteria for Software Testing\nTesting is never complete, so when is enough?\n- Obviously, if significant parts of the program structure are not tested, then testing is inadequate, not finished\n- Leads to idea of \"Coverage\"\n- How much of the code base did we cover with the execution?\n- Starting point, measure how many lines of code are executed\n\t- leads to some percentage of lines covered\n\t- color highlighting for visualization in code editor\n\t- in Eclipse, Eclemma\n\t- this is the stupid button I keep pressing in eclipse\n\t- produces useful statistics\n\t- when you run all of the junit tests it should cover like everything\n\nVarious Control Flow Coverage Criteria Exist\n1. Statement coverage\n   single statement\n   basic block\n2. Branch coverage\n   if/switch conditions, each branch\n3. Condition coverage\n   each basic condition evaluated to true and false\n4. Path coverage\n   execution paths through a method\n5. Data flow\n   define-used pairs of data (see earlier this class like 12 slideshows ago)\n6. Function coverage\nAnd More\n\n![[Pasted image 20221004121053.png]]\nheres a fun graph\nim so tired\n\nlook at slides for this part with the graph its good i just dont wanna write it all\n\nbranch vs path coverage\nif theres like 3 if statements then thats like 6 different branches but like 8 possible paths to traverse through all of them\n\nbranch vs condition coverage\nwith a lot of true false whatever condition coverage tries to be more efficient\ndoes boolean algebra or something i guess so it doesnt have to go down every single path?\n\nmodified condition/decision coverage (MCDC)\nrequires that each basic condition be shown to independently affect the outcome of each decision\nrequirement for airborne systems software testing and stuff its a whole thing\n\nwhat to do if coverage is bad, how do we get it higher can we get much higher\nbad idea: quickly create/adapt tests to improve stats\ngood idea: check what is not covered, and why\n\nskipping ahead bc out of time\n\nsummary\none thing to be clear on\ncode executino does not mean code is correct\nif you had all the tests and then comment out all of the assert statements, youd still have high coverage but with bad tests","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.432918334Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-10-04-JAPN208":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-10-04 Tuesday]] 14:00:41\nmodification date: [[2022-10-04 Tuesday]] 14:00:41\ndescription:: discussing [[Into the Light]]\n\ntalking today about Kim Sa Ryang's Into the Light\n\nbefore that one more thing to talk about from last week\n\"Japan and Korea as One Body\" (*Naisen ittai* \"japana-korea-one-body\")\ntalked last time about Konminka movement, total assimilation; this movement was around the same time\nimportant symbol; marriage between Nashimoto Masako and Yi Un, japanese princess and son of koreas last emperor\n\"japan used marriage politics quite effectively\"\nNashimoto Masako and Yi Un remained married even after Korea's liberation, moved to Seoul\ndifferent from european colonialism; racial difference was important; didnt want colonizers to marry colonized\n\n## [[Into the Light]] by Kim Sa-Ryang\nfirst impressions?\n- characters very well written\n- very engaging story\n- story moved at a calm pace, able to explore a lot of how people felt at the time\n- interesting that story wasnt entirely censored\n- easy story to understand, prose isnt deadly like usual\n\n##### presentations\nkim sa ryang was a korean writer during japanese colonization of korea\nstories embody his experiences\nkoreans are treated as inferior\nnam takes on name mr minami\nharuo serves as antagonist in the beginning, treats being korean as inferior\nrevealed that haruo isnt fully japanese\nmain point of tension is acceptance/denial of these character's korean identities\n\nattending university\nfocus on separation between people in japan\nmany conflicts happening throughout the story\nnam accepting his real name shows him accepting whats happening; is it good or bad\nrelationship between haruo's parents reflects relationship between japan and korea\n\n##### questions from last week\n- What \"borders\" does Kim's story draw our attention to?\n\t- japan and korea is the obvious one\n\t\t- koreans did not want to assimilate\n\t\t- seen as two different national communities\n\t\t- different treatment for koreans in japan\n\t\t- historical context\n\t- linguistic borders\n\t\t- use of korean/japan to show relationship between different people, convey a different tone in conversation\n\t- so sleepy and tired im gonna fall asleep i hate tuesday\n\t- im so tired im gonna fall asleep so sleepy\n\t- identity as a border, psychological border\n\t\t- koreans have to accommodate their identity as foreigners\n\t- koreans going to japan, but also japanese crossing borders to go to korea\n\t\t- koreans are second class citizens in japan\n\t\t- japanese are not treated in a similar way when they go to korea\n\t\t- power imbalance\n\t\t- koreans going to japan for work, need money\n\t\t- japanese going to korea, for travel, vacation, sightseeing\n\t\t- also japanese going to korea to assimilate it, make it more like japan\n\t- economics as a border\n\t\t- korea, more agrarian\n\t\t- japan, more industrial\n\t\t- story focuses on working class neighborhoods in tokyo\n- What tensions and conflicts can you observe in this story? Where do these tensions and conflicts derive from?\n\t- \"full of tension and conflict\"\n\t- gender tension\n\t- tension in how koreans view their identity\n\t- tension in korean relationship to japanese society\n\t- when yi brought haruo's mom to school\n\t\t- think the author is trying to characterize yi as someone who despises assimilation\n\t- conflict between yi and nam\n\t\t- if koreans took japanese names, theyd have better job security\n\t\t- its suppressing korean identity\n\t- nam criticizes himself\n\t- oh is the main character a teacher\n\t- i shouldve read this thing\n- What does this story tell us about ethnic, national, cultural, and imperial identity?\n\t- interesting that the story takes place in japan, characters are already settled in japan\n\t\t- \"all of them have already accepted that korea has been imperialized\"\n\t\t- no matter where they go japan or korea theyll be under japanese rule\n\t- parents of half korean half japanese kids want their kids to abandon korean identity\n\t\t- haruos father has internal conflict\n\t\t- haruos father is half korean half japanese haruos mom is full korean\n\t\t\t- sidenote haruos mom was indebted and worked at a brothel and haruos father paid off her debts and thats why shes so loyal to him\n\t- mixed people are drawn to their korean identity even when they denounce it\n\t- japanese and korean people ethnic identity is blurred; they look similar, they can pass for each other, how does that change things? when usually imperialism takes place over colored lines\n\t\t- needed to make differences distinct, cultural, etc\n\t\t- goes against konminka, assimilation movement\n\t\t- simultaneously trying to bring these peoples together but also keep them separate\n- What do you think of the ending? (this is what everybody said ofc bc i didnt read)\n\t- ending is bittersweet\n\t- does this resolve mr nams identity crisis\n\t- grounded, realistic picture\n\t- dont really like the ending\n\t\t- feels very optimistic\n\t\t- ends with haruo accepting hes half korean and walks into the sunset with mr minami\n\t\t- erases all the stuff that happens, in the story and historically\n\t\t- korean erasure, forgetting the conflicts that happened\n\t- get the impression that haruo has come to terms with his own identity\n\t- like the ending, was good in a lot of ways\n\t\t- about their korean identity, and thats what it wrapped up\n\t\t- their were other issues not resolved, but doesnt need to\n\t\t- real life issues not resolved, but they werent resolved in real life at that time\n\t- ending was emotional\n- How would you summarize the story in a word/phrase\n\t- conflict\n\t- identity\n\t- problems\n\t- parental societal combo\n\t\t- haruo had to deal with both crises, both issues influenced each other\n\t- imperial minorities\n\t- internal struggle\n\t- internal manifestation of conflict\n\t- trauma\n\non thursday\nusually a lecture but this time we have a essay to discuss on Into the Light\nChristina Yi, \"[[National Language, Imperialization, and the Gendered Aporia of Empire]]\"\n\"slightly more difficult reading\"\n\nQuestions for the reading\n- Narrators name is Minami/Nam. What argument does the author make about the politics of these readings?\n- What is the \"hierarchy in the configuration of local imperial identity\" (p. 824)?\n- How does she critique Tokieda Motoki's theory on \"national language\"?\n- How does she read *Into the Light* in relation to this theory\n- What is the \"gendered aporia of

16:51:02\ndescription:: Tang Dynasty writers, Li Gongzuo, Yuan Zhen, Story of Ying-ying\n\nlast time talked about poetry, utopia, environment\nthis time talking about two classical language short stories\nmoving into the tang dynasty\n\n##### The Tang Dynasty 618-907\n- the high tang \n\t- talking about poetry written up to the _ rebellion\n\t- time of great writing\n\n##### Tales of the Strange and the Origins of Fiction\n- starting to write completely fictional stories\n- before this weve seen writing about history with fictional elements, these elements interpreted as having a deeper meaning, metaphorical\n- self consciously fictional: telling a story, for the fun of it\n- cultural influence\n\t- historical indian influence\n- retold in many different forms over time\n\n##### Li Gongzuo 778-848\n- chinese writer\n- wrote some of these tales of the strange\n- prototypical stories, going on to influence other fiction\n- wrote the story we're about to talk about\n\n##### An Account of the Governor of the Southern Branch\n- by Li Gongzuo\n- initial thoughts\n\t- different from what we've read\n\t- how are expectations of stories like this different from others?\n\t\t- not much established structure, previous work, established tropes\n\t- another drunken main character like Kao-Tsu in [[Records of the Grand Historian]]\n- the story\n\t- starts talking about how this guy is not cool\n\t- drinks too much goes around righting wrongs as he sees fit\n\t\t- is this guy batman\n\t\t- also doesnt seem to have best judgement of character\n\t\t- described later on as \"a knight-errant\"\n\t- expectation that this guy is at the bottom, he will get better as story goes on\n\t\t- \"hit harder ~15 years ago before unlikeable main characters became popular\"\n\t- havent talked much about how people rise through power\n\t\t- civilians - pass imperial exams, gain important positions, culturedness\n\t\t- military - go up the ranks in the military due to strength\n\t- strong tendency to place things both in time and geographically\n\t\t- story says it takes place in 791 a few miles of some town, gives a description of what the area looks like\n\t\t- becomes a standard, almost a trope in chinese writing\n\t- we know that at the end he's dreaming of himself in a kingdom of insects\n\t\t- ok so this dude isn't batman he's hollow knight\n\t\t- The Great Nation of Locust Tranquility\n\t- stuff happens\n\t- marriage ceremony\n\t\t- very lavish\n\t\t- \"Lady Flowery Slope, another Ms. Green Stream, another Higher Transcendent, another Lower Transcendent\"\n\t\t- \"daoist names\"\n\t- he becomes governor of the southern branch\n\t\t- sets out to take on the job\n\t\t- writes a memorial and asks king for his friends to come along with him\n\t\t- memorial's language mimics how memorials were really written then\n\t\t- moving faster\n\t\t- hes governor\n\t\t- hes good at it\n\t\t- king becomes worried hes too good\n\t\t- sends his friend to fight the Nation of Sandalwood Creepers, he loses\n\t\t- gains more power\n\t\t- resigns from position, moves back to the capital\n\t\t- still gained power\n\t- wakes up\n\t\t- passes years of his life in this dream and wakes up\n\t\t- him and his buddy finds the tree he thinks he was living in and finds two big ants, the king and the queen, and destroys the kingdom (an anthole)\n\t\t- it was the big locust tree described at the beginning of the story\n\t- died at age 47, just like dad predicted when hed see him in his dream (oh yeah i didnt write that but his dad is there)\n\t- pretense of framing this as history at the end\n\t\t- saying it was a true story written down by the author who met the main character on a trip\n\n##### Yuan Zhen 779-831\n- wrote the next story\n- writer\n- had positions in govt\n- very famous as a close friend of another poet we'll read later\n\n##### The Story of Ying-ying\n- Think about: why was this story so compelling? why is it rewritten so much later? \"fanfics\"\n- Young man named Chang\n\t- traditional protagonist\n\t- cool good guy\n\t- \"gotten to be 23 years old without ever having had relations with a woman\"\n\t- says he hasnt met the right girl\n\t- \"personality of this character is gonna emerge in some interesting ways\"\n\t- white knight nice guy\n\t- \"not super humble\"\n\t- \"queer subtext\"\n\t\t- \"not generally a problem to be queer in Tang dynasty as long as you try to have kids\"\n\t\t- oh real\n\t- \"not like other guys\" and the girl later is \"not like other girls\"\n\t\t- \"manic pixie dream girl\"\n- some military skirmish, Chang has local officer friends that he gets to help protect ppl at the monastery he's staying in\n\t- \"this paragraph in later retellings becomes like 70% of the story\"\n\t- shows political instability at this time\n- Mrs. Ts'ui, one of the people whose lives he saved\n\t- invites him to banquet\n\t- \"your widowed aunt\" \n\t- introduces Chang to her children as their elder brother\n- Chang meets daughter\n\t- he goes insane 4 her\n\t- she's not like other girls\n\t- she doesnt wanna be there\n\t- shes 17\n- Maid of Ying-ying becomes go between for her and Chang\n\t- Chang tries to get her to help him get Ying-ying\n\t- she doesnt want to goes against propriety\n\t- says he's literally going crazy for this girl\n\t- \"I was hardly able to control myself\"\n\t- ok man\n\t- he doesnt even know her, just saw her\n\t- Maid's name is sometimes translated as Crimson, her name becomes a word for the go-between during wedding arrangements, that's how famous the story is\n- Maid tells him that she notices that she writes a lot, he could seduce her with a love poem\n\t- In this version of the story, we never see Chang's poetry, but we see Ying-ying's\n\t- She writes a romantic poem inviting him to see her\n\t\t- doesnt seem very characteristic based on what we know so far\n- Chang climbs up apricot tree to see her\n\t- wakes up maid, shes like wtf, he says oh she told me to be here\n\t\t- over-reading of what the poem really says\n\t- she shows up\n\t\t- shes like wtf thanks for saving us but now youre being weird i wasnt gonna do anything about it but after your poem i had to write something to get you to over here so i could yell at you\n\t- he leaves\n- And then they get together a few days later\n\t- she doesnt say anything for ten days\n\t- hes like ok i cant hang around forever\n- he has to head off, comes back a few months later\n- she plays a zither not knowing Chang can hear her\n\t- image of refinement that she can play this zither, she's very smart\n\t- when Chang tries to talk to her, she stops playing, Chang becomes more infatuated\n- yeah he had to leave to take exams, still no formalization of their relationship despite of what mother wants\n\t- she says cmon youre not gonna marry me \n\t- why isnt he\n- she plays \"Rainbow Robe and Feather Skirt\"\n\t- lost song today\n- he leaves\n- writes a letter to her to reassure her \n\t- shows letter to his friend\n\t- authorial insert\n\t- adds a long poem about the events\n- also shes referred to as Ms. Ts'ui in the reading i didnt say that\n\t- her name isnt said until the end\n- after spending time in capital, decides shes too beautiful, would ruin her, ruin the country, decides he's done with her\n- people hated this ending!\n- so there's rewrite after rewrite where they do get together\n- \"theres so much wrong with this with how theyre acting and how they should be acting\"\n- did the author do it to drum up drama?\n- leads to many new versions that make people happier\n\nthoughts\n- does the author mean for us to think Chang is in the right?\n- seems realistic, people move out and fall out of love\n- can see why people hate the ending, not convincing, seems like author isnt even convinced by ending\n- not like an external circumstance keeping them together, its him being weird\n- he chooses his job over her, but doesnt really feel justified\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.432918334Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-10-05-CSCI243":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-10-05

read/write access for variables\n- if it doesnt change make it a final variable\n- when a variable is passed through a method in java, if it's changed then it changes the original variable\n\ndo you need a value to be exact for it to work?\nex. where every 32 steps they run a block\n- does it have to be 32 steps exactly?\n- why did they use bitwise operators instead of modulo?\n- \"what is the role of local variables such as b m s i pk pe here\"\n- \"what is the role of magic numbers such as 5000 50 100 10 31 here\"\n- should be labeled with a comment!\n\ncode reading\n- follow black box approach\n- update with comments\n\n#####  Self-Documenting Code\nnotes from [[Code Complete]]\n- classes\n\t- name\n\t\t- describes central purpose\n\t- interface\n\t\t- does the class interface present a consistent abstraction\n\t\t- does the class interface make it obvious how the class should be used\n\t\t- is the class interface abstract enough that you dont have to think about how its services are implemented? can you treat the class as a black box?\n\t- class interface definition\n\t\t- a java interface that accompanies class\n\t\t- set of public methods of a class\n- methods\n\t- name\n\t\t- should communicate exactly what the method does\n\t\t- \"easy to name if it only has one job to do instead of fifteen\"\n\t- structure\n\t\t- does each routine have one well defined task\n\t- interface\n\t\t- is each routines interface obvious and clear\n- data/variables/objects\n\t- types\n\t\t- are type names descriptive enough to help document data declarations\n\t\t- are well named **enum types** used instead of makeshift flags or boolean variables\n\t- variables\n\t\t- are variables named well\n\t\t- are variables used only for the purpose for which theyre named\n\t\t- are **loop counters** given more informative names than i, j, k\n\t- constants\n\t\t- are named constants used instead of magic numbers or magic strings\n\t- naming conventions\n\t\t- do naming conventions distinguish among type names, enum types, named constants, local variables, class variables, and global variables\n\t\t- camelcase common practice in java\nmore valuable to emphasize clarity upfront than writing something that is compact, restricted, best performance, least memory\n- control\n1. is nominal path through the code clear?\n2. related statements grouped together?\n3. relatively independent groups of statements, packaged into own routines?\n4. does normal case follow the if rather than the esle?\n5. are control structures simple so they minimize complexity?\n6. does each loop perform one and only one function, as a well defined method would?\n7. is nesting minimized?\n8. have boolean expressions been simplified by using additional boolean variables and functions?\n- data organization\n\t- extra variables for clarity\n\t- references to variables close together\n\t- simple data types to minimize complexity\n\t- is complicated data accessed through abstract access routines (abstract data types)\n- layout\n\t- does the programs layout show its logical structure\n- design\n\t- is the code straightforward, does it **avoid cleverness**\n\t- are implementation details hidden as much as possible\n\t- is the program **written in terms of the problem domain** as much as possible rather than in terms of computer science of programming language structures?\n- anything else\n\t- add comments\n\t\t- to clarify intent\n\t\t- to summarize code\n\t- add code to **assert** properties on intermediate results\n\t\t- assert(boolean condition) : error message;\n\t\t- can make this error message clear as to what the problem is\n\t\t- example: assert the absolute value is 0 \u003c= n \u003c= 10\n\t\t- assert(n \u003e== 0 \u0026\u0026 n \u003c= 10) : \"bad number: + n\";\n\t- in vm, `-ea` means enable assertions\n\t- otherwise doesnt run them in a production environment\n\t- example in presentation go look at it\n\njavadoc formatted comments\n```Java\n/**\n * this is format of a javadoc comment\n * javadoc takes all these comments and turns them into a html documentation\n * @param idk what these tag things do i should look them up but it specifies\n * different stuff like parameters of a method and stuff\n * @return and stuff idk\n */\n```\nshould use this\n\nwhere are we at this point\nhypothesis: code documentation leaves much to desire\nobservation: purpose/intent difficult to recover\n- class level: missing info\n\t- responsibilities, constraints, collaborators, order of operations, thread-safety\n- method level: missing info\n\t- purpose, info carried by individual varibales, parameters, return values\n- class attribute/field level: missing info\n\t- info carried by attribute\n\t- legal range of values, meaning of particular values/magic numbers\n\t- measurement units\n\t- constraints that must hold across several attributes\n\t- state-depending behavior of methods\n\nwhen is the right moment to write documentation\n- before filling an empty body of a method\n\t- add javadoc comments to clarify what method does, inputs\n\t- otherwise keep comments close to code (principle of proximity)\n\t- add comments for foreseen variables\n\t- add comments to method body to itemize important steps\n- while programming the code inside the body of a method\n\t- summarize blocks of code\n\t- surprises, additional insight\n\t- comments for special cases\n\t- assertions\n\t- keep it simple\n- after programming the code of a method\n\t- **rename variables** to longer meaningful names\n\t- tag variables as constant/final whenever possible\n\t- use meaningul names for constants instead of magic numbers\n\t- add comments to variables, init values, usage constraints\n\t- add comments to make the case for termination of loops and recursive method calls\n\t- in general\n\t\t- reread code for correctness\n\t\t- write comments that state the arguments you make for yourself why the method terminates and is correct\n\t\t- **focus on why, not how**\n\nsummary\n- able to recover what a piece of code does but not what the dev wanted it to do\n\t- our document should express this\n- the level of abstraction between code and comments differs, there is no need to comment on the trivial\n- different forms of documentation\n\n**\"dont document bad code, rewrite it\"**","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.432918334Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-10-06-JAPN208":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-10-06 Thursday]]

Language, Imperialization, and the Gendered Aporia of Empire]]\n(i read the wrong reading i was looking at next week's)\n\n## Christina Yi reading\n\n##### presenters\nkominka\nfocuses on kokugo, one of the main policies of kominka, revolved around language\nlooked at the story [[Into the Light]] and a nonfiction work about language, by Tokieda Motoki\npolitics behind readings of characters' names in first print and reprint of the story\nby the end haruo's mother is essentially forgotten by the story\none must reject the tools by which they are constructed\ngendered aporia of empire - contradictory stance of unifying the empire while dividing it by gender\n\nkey points to analyze policy \naddress gender aporia\naporia means contradiction/paradox in theory/argument\ncontradiction within imperialization of japan\nfemale subjects are left behind\nkokugo - national language in japan\ndistinction between kokugo used in korea and nihongo in japan\nstill a distinction in language, hierarchy\nkokugo is japanese, but still doesnt absolve you of korean identity, but allows you to assimlate into japanese empire\nharuo's mother is the only person represented with bad japanese\nharuo doesnt come to terms with his korean identity with his mother, he does so at the end with nam\nmother is left behind\nboth haruo and nam figureheads of good imperial subjects\nmother tongue affects peoples identity, needed to promote education of korean women, in order to pass kokugo to their children\nuse the mothers as tools to teach children then forget about them\nthe mother's mother tongue is korean, but supposed to pass on kokugo as mother tongue to their children\ngoal to create imperial subjects, women and mothers meant to be left out\n\ndistinction between kokugo and nihongo\nbanning native languages in school\nforced adoption of colonial subjects with japanese names\nmothers have to teach kokugo to their children\nkokugo necessary for marginalized subjects\nlanguage of the mainland vs. kokugo and other purposefully bastardized versions\nmother has to pass on versions of lanugage that are not hers\nhave to discard remnants of your marginalized heritage\nkokugo is not the japanese language\n\n\n##### Questions for the reading\n- Narrators name is Minami/Nam. What argument does the author make about the politics of these readings?\n\t- names were written differently in print vs. reprint\n\t- original version in the outlet *Bungei shuto*, consistently [[gloss|glossed]] in katakana script\n\t- when you write names in katakana, its like translating, depicts them as foreigner names\n\t- katakana is usually used for foreign words\n\t- hiragana used in reprint\n\t- nan/minami is represented as one hiragana character, pronunciation changes, and that is shown by the katakana\n\t- in second print, japanese reading is glossed only the first time the name shows up, and not for the rest\n\t- assumption that readers read japanese\n\t- \"this small but telling change transforms the narrator's internal struggle from an either/or choice - either Japanese or Korean - into an and/or dilemma of \"Korean and/or imperial subject\n\t- first printing shows words as equal\n\t- later printing way more skewed towards japanese - no choice\n\t- looks like a minor change, actually very telling in context about the narrator's own internal struggle\n- What is the \"hierarchy in the configuration of local imperial identity\" (p. 824)?\n\t- so tired and sleepy\n\t- korean reading for his name - \"Nan\"\n\t- real korean pronunciation should be \"Nam\"\n\t- in japanese words dont end with \"m\" so in japanese journal they use \"Nan\"\n\t- reader is supposed to be someone who knows japanese - a japanese person\n\t- unmarked reader\n\t- author himself used \"Nan\"\n\t- structurally speaking there is no way to write \"Nam\" in japanese\n\t- Yi is making a point of this change\n- How does she critique Tokieda Motoki's theory on \"national language\"?\n\t- in Motoki's theory mother plays an important role\n\t- mother learns kokugo, passes it on to children\n\t- Motoki critiques linguistic idea that there is no link between language and object\n\t\t- the word \"bag\" has no intrinsic connection to an actual bag, could be any word\n\t\t- Motoki refuted this, says there is connection, spirit of national culture,. whatever\n\t\t- cultural meaning\n\t\t- if you learn language at school, its a tool for communication\n\t\t- if you learn language from your mother, understand cultural connection\n\t- Yi critiques Motoki's ideas\n\t\t- mothers native tongue isnt kokugo, so how would she be able to pass on this culture that is not hers to her child\n\t\t- how can korean mother play this role in indoctrinating children into japanese culture when she is not a member of that culture\n\t\t- aporia emerges from this situation\n\t\t- \"The burden of history falls on the maternal figure split between her own mother tongue (Korean) and the mother tongue (Japanese) that she is to impart to her child.\"\n\t\t- how are children supposed to separate from their mother in this way\n\t\t\t- haruo's character shows this strife, inhibits growth\n\t\t- japanese language is already split into many dialects\n\t\t\t- how can culture be tied to it in this way, how can kokugo be so different and lower than other japanese, when theres already dialects and differences\n\t\t\t- language doesnt work the way Motoki wants it to\n\t- what about when this is put into practice, korean mothers teaching kokugo, what happens\n\t\t- \"While Tokieda's essay ends without addressing this conundrum of the mother, in Into the Light we may catch a glimpse of what happenes when one follows Tokieda's proposal to its logical conclusion: abjection.\"\n\t\t- abjection - rejecting something you cant completely reject/object\n\t\t- mothers are pushed away\n- How does she read *Into the Light* in relation to this theory?\n\t- talked ab allrdy\n- What is the \"gendered aporia of empire\"?\n\t- talked ab alrdy too\n\n\"wanted to give you an example of a close reading of a story\"","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.432918334Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-10-07-CSCI243":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date:

poetry\nknown as some of the best poetry, some of the best poets who have ever lived\ntoday talking about Li Bai and Bai Juyi\nthese poets knew each other\npeople would write poems to each other to commemorate occasions, becomes a social act\nupper class\nwere these poems written to be circulated or were they private works?\n- most were expected to be shared\nnew forms of poetry\n- some poems were rewrites of older poems but in new styles\n- Regulated Verse (\"Modern-Style\")\n\t- modern at the time\n\t- popularized at this time, tang dynasty\n\t- called regulated bc there are rules about what the poetry looked like\n\t- 8 lines of 4 couplets\n\t- 5 or 7 characters per line\n\t- set tonal patterns (Level \\_, Oblique \\_)\n\t- set rhyme schemes\n\t- parallelism, even at the grammatical level\n\t- complicated; good authors of regulated verse were skilled\n- quatrains, like regulated verse but cut in half\nTonal Patterns\nV:Oblique\n\\-: Level\n![[Pasted image

skill in poetry\nbecomes known during his lifetime as a famous poet\nhis poetry is full of a wide variety of themes\nnot particularly autobiographical\na lot of his poems are easier to understand than other poets weve seen\n\n\u003e [!Quote] Still Night Thoughts\n\u003eBefore my bed there's a pool of light  \nI wonder if it's frost on the ground  \nLooking up, I find the moon bright  \nThen bowing my head, I drown in homesickness\n\nreferences to the moon\nAABA rhyme in mandarin\nreferences to missing home\n\n##### Drinking in Li Bai's work\nrecognized as the drunk poet\ntook joy in celebration\ncommon theme in his works is drinking\n\n\u003e [!Quote] Drinking Alone in the Moonlight\n\u003e Beneath the blossoms with a pot of wine,  \nNo friends at hand, so I poured alone;  \nI raised my cup to invite the moon,  \nTurned to my shadow, and we became three.  \nNow the moon had never learned about drinking,  \nAnd my shadow had merely followed my form,  \nBut I quickly made friends with the moon and my shadow;  \nTo find pleasure in life, make the most of the spring.\n\\\nWhenever I sang, the moon swayed with me;  \nWhenever I danced, my shadow went wild.  \nDrinking, we shared our enjoyment together;  \nDrunk, then each went off on his own.  \nBut forever agreed on dispassionate revels, \nWe promised to meet in the far Milky Way.\n\nreferences to the moon again\nfinding pleasure in life\npersonification of nature\nattempts at finding joy in solitude\nlove of drinking\n\n\n##### Poems written for others\n\n\u003e [!Quote] To Meng Hao-jan\n\u003e I love the Master, Meng Hao-jan,\n\u003e A free spirit known the whole world through.\n\u003e In the flush of youth he spurned the cap and carriage,\n\u003e And rests now, white-haired with age, among clouds and pines.\n\nshowing respect to a poet he looked up to, Meng Hao-jan\n\n\u003e [!Quote] To Send to Tu Fu as a Joke\n\u003e I ran into Tu Fu by a Rice Grain Mountain,\n\u003e In a bamboo hat with the sun at high noon.\n\u003e Hasn't he gotten awfully thin since our parting?\n\u003e It must be the struggle of writing his poems.\n\npoking fun at one of his contemporaries, Tu Fu\nlighthearted\nknows that Tu Fu looks up to him\n\n\u003e [!Quote] Poems in an Old Style\n\u003e ...\n\n...\n\npeople writing poetry are usually from aristocratic families\nfor people like Li Bai, sponsorship by the emperor\nmany people were both officials and poets\n\n\n##### Du Fu 712-770\nthe guy from two poems ago\n~10 years younger than Li Bai\nwanted to be a high ranking official, couldnt pass the imperial exams, the highest level\ngiven official position later\ntries to escape the An Lushan rebellion with his family, but captured\na lot of his poetry focuses on these events of his life\n\n\u003e [!Quote] Spring View\n\u003e The nation is ruined, but mountains and rivers remain.  \nThis spring the city is deep in weeds and brush.  \nTouched by the times even flowers weep tears,  \nFearing leaving the birds tangled hearts.  \nWatch-tower fires have been burning for three months\nBeacon fires three months in succession,  \na letter from home worth ten thousand in gold.  \nWhite hairs, fewer for the scratching,  \n\u003esoon too few to hold a hairpin up.\n\none of his most famous poems\nwritten while in captivation with his family\npoem about wartime\nregulated verse, 4 couplets of 5 characters\npessimistic, heavier topics\nAn Lushan rebellion was around 755\nusing spring, flowers, birds, to express grief\n\n\n##### Du Fu and Li Bai\nits giving sam and cat?\n\nthink about how Du Fu references Li Bai vs how Li Bai references Du Fu\n\n\u003e [!Quote] At the Sky's End, Thinking of Li Po\n\u003e Cold winds rise from the edge of heaven\nTrue Gentleman how fares your thought\nwild geese what hour is your arrival\nriver and lake swell with autumn waters\nliterature is adverse to good fortune\nmarsh trolls relish the passerby\nyou ought to share a word with the slandered spirit\nhurl a poem to him in the Mi-lo River\n\nDu Fu had respect for Li Bai\nmention of Gentleman, like [[The Analects|Confucius]]\nmention of Mi-lo River, where [[2022-09-21 CHIN309#Qu Yuan|Qu Yuan]] committed suicide\n\nunlike Li Bai, Du Fu's poetry wasn't recognized as exceptional until hundreds of years later\nhis poetry is very biographical\nwrote in regulated verse\n~1400 of his poems

the high autumn skies of September\nthe wind cried out in rage,\nTearing off in whirls from my rooftop\nthree plies of thatch.\nThe thatch flew across the river,\nwas strewn on the floodplain,\nThe high stalks tangled in tips\nof tall forest trees,\nThe low ones swirled in gusts across ground\nand sank into mud puddles\nThe children from the village to the south\nmade a fool of me, impotent with age,\nWithout compunction plundered what was mine\nbefore my very eyes,\nBrazenly took armfuls of thatch,\nran off into the bamboo,\nAnd I screamed lips dry and throat raw,\nbut no use.\n(first half of poem)\n\ncomplaining about roof being blown down and kids stealin his thatch and his throat is dry\nhe talks about his symptoms, ails, sorrows\n- he talked about his symptoms so much he's the oldest recognized case of diabetes based on his poems\n\ninteresting perspective\nhe suffered from poverty, and now we know chronic illness\n\n\u003e [!Quote] A Song on How My Thatched Roof Was Ruined by the Autumn Wind cont.\n\u003e ...\n\u003e Then I made my way home, leaning on staff,  \nsighing to myself.  \nA moment later the wind calmed down,  \nclouds turned dark as ink,  \nThe autumn sky rolling and overcast,  \nblacker towards sunset,  \nAnd our cotton quilts were years old  \nand cold as iron,  \nMy little boy slept poorly,  \nkicked rips in them.  \nAbove the bed the roof leaked,  \nno place was dry,  \nAnd the raindrops ran down like strings,  \nwithout a break.  \nI have lived through upheavals and ruin  \nand have seldom slept very well,  \nBut have no idea how I shall pass  \nthis night of soaking  \nOh, to own a mighty mansion  \nof a hundred thousand rooms,  \nA great roof for the poorest gentlemen  \nof all this world,  \na place to make them smile  \nA building unshaken by wind or rain,  \nas solid as a mountain,  \nOh, when shall I see before my eyes  \na towering roof such as this?  \nThen I'd accept the ruin of my own little hut  \nand death by freezing.\n\naw man this is sad\ndespair and helplessness\nwishes for something better\nwhat he would give to see something better for others in his situation\nmention of scholars\none of his most striking poems\n\n\n\u003e [!Quote] Recruiting Officer of Shih-hao\n\u003e At dusk I sought lodging at Shih-hao village,\nWhen a recruiting officer came to seize men at night.\nAn old man scaled the wall and fled,\nHis old wife came out to answer the door.\n\\\nHow furious was the officer’s shout!\nHow pitiable was the woman’s cry!\nI listened as she stepped forward to speak:\n“All my three sons have left for garrison duty at Yeh;\nFrom one of them a letter just arrived,\nSaying my two sons had newly died in battle.\nSurvivors can manage to live on,\nBut the dead are gone forever.\nNow there’s no other man in the house,\nOnly a grandchild at his mother’s breast.\nThe child’s mother has not gone away;\nShe has only a tattered skirt for wear.\nAn old woman, I am feeble and weak,\nBut I will gladly leave with you tonight\nTo answer the urgent call at Ho-yang—\nI can still cook morning gruel for your men.”\n\\\nThe night drew on, but talking stopped;\nIt seemed I heard only half-concealed sobs.\nAs I got back on the road at daybreak,\nOnly the old man was there to see me off.\n\nrecruiters took people, people didnt want to go to war\ngrief and horror of war\nthe old man runs to escape recruitment, they take his wife instead\n\n\u003e [!Quote] A Guest Arrives\n\u003e North and south of my cottage, spring waters everywhere—\nAll I can see are a flock of terns that come day after day;\nThe flowery path has not been swept for any guests,\nOnly today do I finally open my gate for you.\nThe market is far, so our supper platter lacks variety,\nOur family is poor, so the wine flask holds but old home-brew;\nIf you’re willing to sing with the gaffer next door,\nI’ll call across the fence for him to finish the last cup.\n\njoy of being able to be with others\nsadness he cant service his friends materially in the way he wants to\n\n\n\n\n\"insultingly short introduction to Li Bai and Du Fu\"\n\"perhaps the most celebrated poets in the world\"\n\nnext time talking

searching through the notes\" ahahaha i have obsidian search\n\n##### Factoring out\n![[Pasted image 20221010110829.png]]\nfactors that do not depend on the summation index can be factored out\n![[Pasted image 20221010110904.png]]\n\n$\\sum^n_{i=1} \\sum^n_{j=1} a_i b_j = \\sum^n_{i=1} a_i \\sum^n_{j=1} b_j$\nalso can switch the above\n$\\sum^n_{i=1} a_i \\sum^n_{j=1} b_j =

squares\n\t- Let $S = \\sum^n_{j=1} j^2$\n\t- First lets replace $j^2$ with an arithmetic summation\n\t\t- Let $a, d$ be the parameters of the arithmetic series\n\t\t- Then $\\sum^n_{j=1} (a + id) = aj + d \\frac {j(j+1)} {2} = j^2$\n\t\t- Choosing $d = 2$ gives $a = -1$, and this $\\sum^n_{j=1} (2i = 1) = j^2$\n\t- Thus\n\t\t- man i am not writing this out \\\n\t\t- $S = \\sum^n_{j=1} j^2$\n\t\t- $= \\sum^n_{j=1} \\sum^j_{i=1} (2i-1)$\n\t\t- $\\overset{*}{=}  \\sum^n_{j=1} (2j - 1) (n - j + 1)$\n\t\t\t- the asterisk means something idk\n\t\t- $= \\sum^n_{j=1} (2jn - 2j^2 + 2j - n + j - 1)$\n\t\t- $= -2S + \\sum^n_{j=1} (2jn + 3j) - n(n+1)$\n\t\t- $= -2S + (2n + 3)n(n+1) \\frac 1 2 - n(n+1) = S$\n\t\t- $\\rightarrow 3S = n\\frac {(n+1)(2n+1)} 2$\n\t- what does $\\overset{*}{=}$

make connecting IDs all the same when you break down a connecting wall\n- multiple ways to solve the problem\n\ntest 2 due tomorrow just like last one (lame)\nmoving on to module 3 after\n\nproject 3 is coming up\nfirst talking about debugging then will talk more about project 3\n\n[[CS301_M2L4_Debugging_PresentationSlides.pdf]]\n## Debugging\nsimilar processes in all IDEs\nusing a debugger\nthink of coding execution as a movie, happens in sequence 1 frame/step at a time\ndebugger lets you look at each step, fast forward and stop at the parts you want to see\ndebugger lets you navigate forward through a program\n\n##### Overview\n- Debugging and its Issues\n- Finding a Defect\n- Fixing a Defect\n\t- finding vs fixing\n- Psychological Considerations in Debugging\n- Debugging Tools\n\n##### Bugs vs Errors vs Faults\n- Why is debugging worth a look\n- Fastest programmers vs. Slowest programmers data\n\t- need to be careful when fixing things, can create defects when correcting defects\n\n##### Defects as Opportunities\nCan learn from mistakes\n- the program you are working on\n- the kind of mistakes you make\n- the quality of your code from the pov of someone who has read it\n- learn about how you solve problems\n- how you fix defects\n\n##### Stupid Strategies\nan incomplete list\n- Find the defect by guessing\n\t- debugging has a sense of guessing\n\t- becomes bad if it's **unsystematic**\n- Dont waste time trying to understand the problem\n- Fix the error with the most obvious fix\n\t- fixing one case that doesnt work by giving it its own method; likely there are other cases that dont work and will also give errors\n- Debugging by superstition\n\t- claim that root causes are elsewhere; it's eclipse's fault (except like sometimes it is)\n\n##### Finding a Defect\n- From the scientific method\n\t- Gather data through repeatable experiments\n\t- Form a hypothesis that accounts for the data\n\t- Design an experiment to prove/disprove hypothesis\n\t- Prove/disprove hypothesis\n\t- Repeat as needed\n- \"The Scientific Method of Debugging\"\n\t1. Stabilize the error\n\t2. Locate the source of the error (\"the fault\")\n\t\t1. Gather data that produces the defect\n\t\t2. Analyze the data and form a hypothesis about the defect\n\t\t3. Determine how to prove/disprove the hypothesis, either by testing the program or by examining the code\n\t\t4. Prove/disprove the hypothesis by using procedure 2.3\n\t3. Fix the defect\n\t4. Test the fix\n\t5. Look for similar errors\n\t6. How can you improve testing?\n\n##### Stabilize the Error\n- If difficult to reproduce\n\t- check list of prime suspects for random values during execution\n\t\t- variable used without initialization\n\t\t- variable refers to freed memory that is used elsewhere\n\t\t- multithreading: race conditions\n\t\t- multithreading: timing issues, order of execution\n\t\t- execution of program not memoryless, state in persistent storage\n- Find a test case that reproduces the error each time executed\n- Vary the test case to recognize which factor influences the error and which ones do not\n- Simplify the test case to the smallest amount of gactors and data and functionality executed to produce the error\n\n##### Locate the Source of the Error\n- Brainstorm to produce a set of hypotheses\n- Create experiments, additional tests toto obtain data to prove/disprove hypothesis and to locate the error\n\n##### Tips for Finding Defects\nan imcomplete series\n- brainstorm possible hypotheses\n- keep a notepad handy and make a list of things to try\n- exercise the code in your unit test suite\n- use available **tools**\n\t- interactive debuggers\n\t- memory checkers\n\t- picky compilers\n\t- static code checkers\n\t- many tools to work with that could find errors/give more information\n- refine the test cases that produce the error\n- **reproduce** the error in several different ways\n- generate more data to generate more hypotheses\n- use the reults of negative tests\n- **narrow** the suspicious region of the code\n- be suspicious of classes and routines that have had defects before\n- check code with recent changes\n- **expand** the suspicious region of code\n- integrate incrementally\n- check for common defects\n- **talk to someone else** about the problem; confessional debugging\n\n##### Brute Force Debugging\nan expensive fallback, plan B\n- design/review/recode\n\t- perform a full design and/or code review on broken code\n\t- throw away the whole program/suspected section of code and redesign/recode from scratch\n- compile code\n\t- with full debugging info\n\t- at pickiest warning level\n\t- fix all compiler warnings\n- testing\n\t- strap on a unit test harness and test suspected code in isolation\n\t- create an automated test suite and run it all night\n- debugging\n\t- step through a big loop in the debugger manually until you get to the error\n\t- instrument code with print/display/logging info\n- environment and tools\n\t- use a different compiler, program, environment\n\t- link/run code against special libraries or execution environments\n\t- replicate the end-user's full machine configuration\n- bottom up\n\t- new code in small pieces, fully testing each piece as it's integrated\n\n##### A Few Notes\non syntax errors, and if the editor is not smart\n- dont trust line numbers in compiler messages\n\t- also check the lines around it, in particular the ones before\n- dont trust conpiler messages\n\t- there is a problem, but the wording is sometimes misleading\n- dont trust the compilers second message\n\t- once something is wrong (first message)\n- divide and conquer\n\t- partition program into sections using comments and compile individual sections\n- find misplaced comments and quotation marks\n\t- for C, C++, and Java, insert `/*\"/**/` which will terminate either a comment of a string\n\n##### Fixing a Defect\n- Finding an error is hard, fixing it is often easy\n\t- seperate the two into separate tasks\n\t- pitfall: being easy makes us careless\n\t\t- fixing an error causes errors\n- Recommendations\n\t- understand problem befroe fixing\n\t- understand program, not just problem\n\t- confirm the defect diagnosis\n\t- relax\n\t- save the original source code\n\t- **fix the problem, not the symptom**\n\t- change the code only for good reason\n\t- make one change at a time\n\t- check your fix\n\t- add a unit test theat exposes the defect\n\t- look for similar defects\n\n##### Psychological Considerations\n- **Debugging Blindness** thanks to \"Pyschological Set\"\n- Brain makes shortcuts based on expectations\n- Here:\n\t- students expect \"while\" condition to be checked at all times\n\t- programmer uses 2 variables SYSTSTS and SYSSTSTS instead of 1\n\t- programmer reads syntax the wrong way (curly braces, indentation, semicolons)\n- Once understood, more clear why good programming practices are necessary\n\t- Formatting\n\t- Commenting\n\t- Variable names\n\t- Routine names\n\t- such that likely defects appear as variations and stick out\n- \"Pyschological Distance\" can help us\n\t- ![[Pasted image 20221011115532.png]]\n\n##### Debugging Tools\n- Interactice Debuggers\n- Others\n\n##### Eclipse Debugger\n- tutorials\n\t- check Mark Dexter's Tutorials on the eclipse debugger\n- basics\n\t- step by step execution, break points\n\t- exploration of variables, data structures and stack frames\n- advances\n\t- expressions\n\t- more on breakpoints\n\t\t- exception breakpoints\n\t\t- conditional breakpoints, hit counts\n\t\t- watch points (field breakpoints)\n\t- on the fly: change variables, hot code replacement\n\n\n\n## Project 3\n\nwant to add a driver to the maze\ncontrol theory\nthink of a thermostat that controls heating\n- observes, measures a system it controls\n- uses **sensors** to obtain information\n- control, makes decisions based on rules\n- has the means to influence the system, **activators**\n\nrobot interface\n- provides a level of abstraction for the driver\n- \"not operating the real thing on the floor, playing a game\"\n\ncontrol\n- normally a user clicks a button, control takes that and moves\n- robot interfaces with control to make moves\n\ncontrol is split up into multiple parts for gui, maze, etc\nStatePlay\n- interacts with the map and drawing and stuff\n\n\nwhere are walls?\n- have a robot\n- has a distance sensor in one direction\n\t- which face should it be mounted on?\n\t- how many do you need?\n- driver asks robot, whats on your left hand side, etc ?\n- robot relays sensor information\n- sensor looks at floorplan to get this information, knows which way its facing, uses CardinalDirection\n- driver thinks of direction as right left forward backward\n- controller keeps track of x, y, cardinaldirection\n\t- cardinal direction is forward for the robot\n\t- aka sensor on the left side of robot will be one counterclockwise cardinal direction from robot's forward\n\n\nDriver $\\rightarrow$ Robot $\\rightarrow$ Control $\\rightarrow$ StatePlay\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  $\\rightarrow$ Sensor $\\rightarrow$ Floorplan\n\nchallenge is figuring out if the sensor (can be F B L R) and current forward direction (can be N S E W)\nchallenge for sensor is knowing what direction to check\nchallenge is to translate this into a cardinal direction to use on the floorplan\n- this doesnt seem difficult sbould i be scared\n- am i suppsed to implement all the combinations as a table why would i do that it can just be turning\n\nthen on the floorplan\nif youre here and in facing this direction\nthen for the direction youre interested in\nhow far away is the wall\n\n\n\n[[CS301_M3L1a_SWProcesses_PresentationSlides.pdf]]\n## Software Processes\nwe got 5 min left why are we starting another slideshow\n\n##### Software Process\n- Most software development

tax is fixed; 3%, very high for peasants; reduced later to 2.5%\n\t- with individual tax system, cant get help from others when you have a bad harvest\n\t- new taxation not popular among peasants, many became poorer\n- Seinan War, 1877\n\t- civil war within japan\n\t- seinan = \"southwest\"\n\t- largest samurai rebellion in japan\n\t- many frustrated samurai who didnt obey new Meiji govt\n\t- Kyushu island\n\t- govt eventually suppressed the rebellion, but had to spend a lot of money\n\t- increased government spending $\\rightarrow$ more money printed\n\t- led to severe inflation\n- Matsukata reform and deflation, 1881-\n\t- Matsukata was a finance minister\n\t- implemented fiscal reform to calm down inflation\n\t- resulted in severe deflation\n\t- this deflation put peasants in trouble\n\t- many peasants couldnt pay tax because value of goods dropped\n- Impoverished farmers sell land, leave for cities, emigrate abroad...\n\t- those in cities become wage laborers\n\t- industries were growing in cities, required labor\n\t- shift towards industrial economy from agrarian economy\n\t- others left japan, went to places like Hawaii, the United States, as early as 1880s\n- First government sponsored emigration to Hawaii, 1885; followed by immigration to US mainland\n\t- govt encouraged people to move to these places\n\t- as population grew, fear that japan was too small, not enough jobs/food for all these people\n\n##### Japanese Government Criteria for Emigration to Hawaii, 1885\n- primary source, criteria for those who want to emigrate\n\t- \"The emigrant laborer shall meet the following conditions\"\n\t- \"A person who falls under any of the under-mentioned catergories shall not be eligible for recruitment\"\n\t- couldnt bring kids, must be single or married with no dependents\n\t\t- didnt give enough money to support kids\n\t- cant suffer from chronic diseases\n\t\t- tuberculosis was spreading, no cure at the time\n- shows how japan govt was not just encouraging people, but selecting people to work outside of the country\n\n##### Japanese Americans within Asian American History/Context\nChinese immigrants and other Asian immigrants also coming to the United States at this time\n- The Chinese Exclusion Act, 1882\n\t- banned immigration of chinese laborers/workers to the United States\n\t- anti asian sentiment was growing in the US\n- First government sponsored emigration to Hawaii, 1885; followed by immigration to US mainland\n\t- as of 1885 Hawaii was still an independent kingdom\n\t- 1898 Hawaii was incorporated into American territories\n\t- sugarcane and coffee farming in Hawaii\n\t- many japanese laborers started farming businesses in Hawaii\n- The Asiatic Exclusion League, 1905\n\t- started in california, san francisco\n\t- many japanese people were moving to california\n\t- promoted anti asian sentiment\n\t- idea that asian workers who were willing to work for cheap wages were stealing jobs from white american workers\n\t\t- sounds familiar (im gonna die)\n- Criticism of Japanese Immigrants by the Asiatic Exclusion League, 1908\n\t- primary source example\n\t- \"While the Japanese are engaged in every occupation,... and solicit the patronage of the whites, they trade exclusively with themselves and their earnings and profits, except so musch as is spent for absolute necesseities, finds its way to Japan ador investment...\"\n\t- similar rhetoric to today (we live in a society)\n\t- fearmongering\n\t- complaining about how cheap everything is now even though that benefits them (i hate mondays)\n\t- painting each group as cohesive; there are white workers getting paid dirt too\n- Segregation of Japanese children from public schools in San Francisco, 1906\n\t- couldnt attend same public schools as white kids\n\t- american sense of superiority to japanese\n\t- \"solution these govts came up with is very interesting\"\n- Gentlemen's Agreement, 1907\n\t- Japanese migration to Brazil increases\n\t- basically ends emigration to the United States\n\t- workers could no longer come to the US unless to join family living there or continuing previously acquired work\n\t- instead of the US banning japanese immigration, japan decided to stop it\n\t- japan govt wanted the people already in the US to be treated fairly\n\t- US govt settles with this\n\t- number of japanese immigrants to the united states dropped sharply, many went to Brazil/South America instead\n\t- 1930s, some moved to Manchuria\n\t- Japanese workers currently in america at this point were young single men\n\t- couldnt marry white women, but japanese women couldnt move to the united states without passports\n\t- many japanese men's families found wives for them in japan, who then moved to the US to unite with them without having ever met before; \"picture bride\"\n- Immigration Act of 1924\n\t- introduced quota system for number of immigrants of each country/nationality, set at 2% of population of each country/nationality already in the US as of 1890 national census\n\t- 1890! that was so long ago\n\t- favored immigrants from european, already developed countries\n\nPoster promoting Japanese immigration to Brazil\n![[Pasted image 20221011150505.png]]\n\n##### Yellow Peril\n- Emerged in late 19th centurry\n- Fueled by Japan's victory in Sino-Japanese War 1894-1895\n![[Pasted image 20221011150921.png]]\n\n##### Eiichiro Azuma, [[Japanese Immigrant Settler Colonialism in the US-Mexican Borderlands and the US Racial-Imperialist Politics of the Hemispheric 'Yellow Peril']]\nwhat a title\nQuestions to think about while reading\n- By \"settler colonialism,\" what does teh author mean?\n- What is the author's main argument?\n- \"Race\" is an important category of analysis in the author's argument.

the nature of confucian thought\n\t- poetry\n- positive feedback loop\n\t- meta strat was to write essays based on ideas the examiners liked\n- in later periods, over abundance of intellectual people trying to take the exam, becomes competitive\n- people spend their entire careers going to the capital taking the exams again and again\n\n##### Wang Wei cont\nback to wang wei\n- passes exam at 22\n\t- renessaince man\n\t- at the pinnacle of official success\n\t- already popular for his poetry\n\t- appointed as court musician\n\t- soon after he offended someone and was sent to run a granary\n\t- works his way back up, demoted again when one of his friends upsets the emperor\n\t- captured by An Lushan rebellion\n\t- pretended he was deaf, drank poison to destroy his voice\n\t- still arrested when he got back to the empire because he was suspected to be a traitor\n\t- his brother became an important official and got him pardoned\n- his poetry\n\t- bhuddist aesthetic\n\t- most were quatrains; short poems\n\t- quatrains: 4 couplets of 5 characters\n- Climbing Pien-chueh Temple\n\t- bhuddist setting\n\t- \"nice little scene where people are getting together and practicing buddhism\"\n\t- by this time, rapid expansion/popularity of buddhism\n- Second Song for the Worship of the Goddess at Yu Mountain: \"Bidding the Goddess Farewell\"\n\t- nature\n\t- mysticism\n\t- buddhist, bc we know he was buddhist, but could be daoist\n\t\t- whats the difference?\n\t\t- \"in cases with a lot of discussion of enlightenment, being along in nature, without necessarily calls to Buddhist jargon, difficult to distinguish Daoist from Buddhist\"\n\t\t- Buddhism in china is very influenced by Daoism\n\t\t- \"buddhism involves moving beyond the world in a way daoism doesnt imply\"\n- Deer Enclosure\n\t- empty mountain, but still hears the echoes of someones voice\n\t- very short poem\n- Army Ballad\n\t- very different tone\n\t- \"the bugle blows, setting the marchers moving,\" \n\t- glorification of war?\n\t- \"sounds of battle within the dust and mist\"\n\t- mundaneity of war?\n\t- is this from when he was captured/in reference to it?\n\n\n##### Bai Juyi 772-846\n- latest of the Tang poets we'll mention specifically\n- born at the end of the An Lushan rebellion, period where people perceived that the Tang dynasty was on decline, past its prime\n\t- official in the Tang govt, wrote a lot of poetry centered around being an official\n\t- his brother wrote short stories\n\t- came from a poor family with a strong emphasis on education\n\t- social mobility was possible through the civil service exam\n\t- takes up position in the capital at 28\n\t- becomes buddies with [[2022-10-05 CHIN309#Yuan Zhen 779-831|Yuan Zhen]]\n\t- political whatever i missed it\n\t- retires\n- his poetry\n\t- simple to understand, simple to translate\n\t- what happens when someone takes current events and turns them into a poem?\n\t- wrote a lot about things that recently happened\n- The Song of Lasting Regret\n\t- about the relationship between the Emperor Hsuan Tsung and Lady Yang (missed her name) (Yang Guifei got it) and how it led to the An Lushan rebellion\n\t\t- emperor falls in love with this girl\n\t\t- starts neglecting imperial duties\n\t\t- he starts giving more and more power to a distant cousin of Lady Yang\n\t\t- An Lushan is accumulating power on the corners of the empire\n\t\t- rebellion happens emperor and party flee the capital\n\t\t- soldiers mutiny while fleeing, kill the distant cousin, and tell the emperor they wont continue unless they put Lady Yang to death too for causing this, he eventually does\n\t\t- later they are able to go back to the capital and his son becomes emperor and whatever\n\t- poem set in Han dynasty, but everybody knows who this is about\n\t- retells this story\n\t- \"lot of cross cultural pollination happening at the time\"\n\t\t- someone asked if Yang Guifei was Han Chinese or some other ethnicity and it seems she is but even if she wasnt thats surprisingly not something that would have really mattered at this time\n\t- these events happened like ~40 years ago when this was written\n\t- kind of a dangerous thing to write about\n\nother poems\n\n##### Meng Chiao 751-814 \n\"On Failing the Examination\"\n- sad poem\n- he actually had enormous success in the exams, passed when he was like in his 40s\n- had a bad life, family died young\n- once he passed realized he wasnt suited for officialdom \n- didnt like being an official\n\n##### Hsueh Tao ~770-832\n- in Tang Dynasty more cases of women becoming educated, but still in service to male officials\n- Hsueh Tao became famous for being brilliant\n- Listening to a Monk Play the Reed Pipes\n\t- different from kind of poems we read from scholar officials\n\t- form is different\n\n##### Cold Mountain\n- \"more of an idea than necessarily a person\"\n- Untitled Poems\n\t- very buddhist poems\n\n\nfall

Lyric Poetry\n- main innovation of this kind of poetry\n\t- more flexible than regulated verse in certain ways\n- set pattern of tones and rythm\n- pattern depends on the title\n\t-  title shows us how rhymes pattern stuff happens\n\t- another layer of complexity\n\t- difficult kind of poem to write, only a few people were considered masters of the form\n- known for being emotional\n\t- express desire\n\n##### Ouyang Xiu 1007-1072\n- known for reform, travelled around china\n- career full of lots of ups and downs\n- ancient style writing\n\t- wanted his works to be legible to more people, and more people could read ancient style\n\t- he was an examiner in the imperial exams\n\t- flunked people that used the newer styles of writing\n- The New Tang History\n\t- rewriting the history of

awesome i didnt even check it man\n\t- pg 158 in columbia reader\n- Tune: \"Drunk in Fairyland\"\n\t- title tells us about the rhyme, rythtm\n- written by Ouyang Xiu\n- \"Shyly she knits her brows / And shows a face delicately rouged:\"\n\t- goodness\n\t- about an affair\n\t- unorthodox to have serious poetry about this topic at this time\n- \"I've needlework to do for mother\"\n\t- \"women existed in private life\"\n\t- women would embroider, etc to contribute to family\n- doesnt really mention the male figure, \"out of frame\"\n- neither character isnt really described, just their actions\n- so whats the title mean?\n\t- written to the tune \"drunk in fairyland\"\n\t- like writing to the tune of twinkle twinkle little star\n\t- the origin of many of these tunes are unclear\n\t- dont have music for most of these\n\n##### The Three Zithers\n- poetry is the most respected, highest form of writing in chinese litterature\n- people engage in poetry different from other writings\n- here is a prose writing from Ouyang Xiu\n- writing about his family's three zithers\n- \"one doesnt need three zithers\"\n- \"ouyang presents this as an embarrassment of riches\"\n- \"But the important thing about a zither, after all, is how it sounds, not who made it.\"\n- one has gold studs, jade studs, stone studs\n- having gold and jade studs is too much\n- an old man should only need

How did that act change his life?\n- How does he interact with his family (ie mother, father, and brother)?\n- How did his family experience the war?\n- How does postwar American society treat him and \"no no boys\"?\n\t- and how does the Japanese American community treat them?\n- What tensions can we observe in this novel? What are the sources of those tensions?\n\t- between issei and nissei, between japanese and americans, and more\n- How can we consider the historical significances of \"no no boys\" within the context of American democracy?\n\t- although nissei were american citizens, they were interned based on national origin\n- When the experiences of Japanese Americans vary so much, would it still make sense to talk about the \"history of Japanese Americans\"?\n\n\n## [[Unthinking Collaboration - American Nisei in Transwar Japan]]\n##### History of the Moment\nUnthinking Collaborators and the Way We \"Do\" History\nlecture from Carly Buxton\n- Tokyo Rose\n- Nisei and WWII\n- forced internment\n- Tokyo Rose was the name for female radio broadcasters\n\t- Iva Toguri \n\t- graduated UCLA \n\t- went to japan in 1941 to care for an aunt\n\t- common for people to go back and forth between US and Japan\n\t- eventually hired by radio tokyo\n\t- becomes radio host for the zero hour\n\t- after ww2, media wants the story with tokyo rose\n\t- Iva Toguri says she is tokyo rose, but really theres many\n\t- she becomes the image of the japanese american traitor\n- there were tens of thousands of other japanese americans living in japan during the war\n\t- many people like toguri, grew up in us, spoke fluent english, probably not much japanese, found themselves in japan during wwii\n\t- what was it like to live in japan with a us passport?\n- collaboration\n\t- \"a dirty word in the history book\"\n\t- treason, traitorous\n\t- thats not where the story ends\n\t- why would an individual collaborate with other parties?\n- white people interned as well\n\t- incoming ships after pearl harbor, white people were interned\n\t- these women went into helping japan in war effort, men were enlisted\n- the iceberg of the human mind / History of the Moment\n\t- why do we look at history through the 5% cognition - what people say, and not look at the 95% - the subconcious, the thoughts, biases\n\t- all the other factors that influence why a person becomes a traitor - why a person collaborates\n- cultural hybridity\n\t- many issei planned to go back to japan\n\t- coming from an impoverished background, plan to make their fortune in the us and go back to japan\n\t- eventually, these families start to stay\n\t- nisei - the pull between the two sides of their identity\n\t- weight of becoming upstanding citizens that speak great english but also be connected to japan and speak great japanese\n\t- push and pull\n\t- stereotypes and expectations\n\t- arent at home in either culture, seen as second class citizens, yet seen as a **bridge** between japan and the us\n- mary kimoto\n\t- similar story to tokyo rose\n\t- worked at a school designed for nisei coming back to japan to study japanese culture and then go back to the us\n- \"Soft Propaganda\"\n\t- when you think of propaganda, billboards, posters, speeches, etc\n\t- standardized dress campaign - during war in japan everybody wore a uniform (mostly among men) - psychology of affinity, solidarity\n\t- style changing - european garb to japanese style\n\t- baseball - changed all its katakana words to kanji - suppressing western styles etc\n- life in wartime japan\n\t- it was hard!\n- internment in japan\n\t- white americans interned, later sent home\n\t- subliminal too\n- memory\n\t- many of these individuals have recently passed, Iva Toguri died in 2006\n\t- many stories have been archived, many people still living today as well\n\t- Kay Nishimura - Buxton interviewed in 2014\n\t- Kay was nisei, served japan and stayed thrre - would be easy to tell his story in a negative way - but he has to serve, stranded in japan\n- assimilation\n\t- individual becomes part of the larger society, subduing or giving up ethnic culture\n- fusion\n\t- two cultures combine to produce a new culture\n\t- nisei oscillated between cultures\n- how history spreads\n\t- people say stuff and that gets passed down\n\t- common misconception that no japanese were on the ships that brought interned white americans back to the us - Buxton looked at the ship records and found this was not true\n\t- sources cant be trusted\n- Unthinking Collaboration - Learning Guide\n\t- fun activities and cool stuff publisher wouldnt let her put in the book - on her website\n\nQuestions\n- they suppresed western culture in japan, the enemy - did they suppress german culture, their ally?\n\t- complex issue\n\t- germans thought the same thing of japanese people\n- relationships within families for people who stayed in us, people who went to japan\n\t- not passed down in japan or the us that there were white americans fighting for japan, part of the japanese war effort\n\t- only been coming out in recent years\n\t- families were divided\n- gender roles\n\t- patriotic young women, should be ever supportie of the war effort\n\t- for men, image of the stalwart soldier\n- how was it determined who was japanese and who wasnt, etc\n\t- loyalty was tested\n\t- on japan side, such a case by case basis, if you looked japanese you were considered japanese\n\t- mixed people whose ethnicity would be questioned - half japanese, whose fathers were white\n\t- also had to do with gender\n- how do you think of collaboration\n\t- its not black and white\n\t- influenced by backstory\n\t- interested in the word collaboration because \"it has been so tortured throughout history\", could have done the same with the word loyalty, or treason\n- have you looked into the renunciation of marxist beliefs after the war\n\t- found it so parallel\n\t- people who were imprisoned and forced to renounce their beliefs\n- human agency and free will\n\t- come into play when you look backward\n- consequences after the war\n\t- if you were conscripted/had no choice probably got your passport back\n\t- case by case\n- now\n\t- Buxton works as a user experience researcher\n\t- themes that underlie the work she did help her understand how people feel/think today in her work\n- intances that eased the tensions between white americans and japanese at the time\n- The Teahouse of the August Moon\n- the cover\n\t- 3 women representing pre war, wartime, post war\n\nwww.carlybuxton.com","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.436918306Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-10-21-CSCI243":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-10-21

(solution/answer)\n- definiteness (well-defined steps)\n- correctness (provably)\n- generality (working for all possible inputs of a certain category)\n- finiteness (no infinite loops)\n- effectiveness (performable steps)\n\t- time, space, power, energy, real-time, QoS\n\t- focus on time and space as a function of problem (input) size\n\t- e.g. size of the database to search, number of cities to travel to, etc\n\nWe use the theory we learned to sum a series of numbers of operations and express them in terms of asymptotic notation (big-O).\nUse the theory on sums, serie,s big-O,

How did that act change his life?\n\t- his mother's influence, mom planted the seeds of his refusal\n\t- finds internment unjust, questions it on his own terms\n\t- his frustration with being interned, marginalized\n\t- after getting out of prison, people looked down on him\n\t- shifted his outlook\n\t- this is what carly buxton was talking about last week, [[Unthinking Collaboration: American Nisei in Transwar Japan]], talking about how japanese americans made these decisions, what influenced them consciously and subconciously\n\t- we see these conscious and unconscious influences in ichiro (i guess idk i havent read it still)\n\t- also they didnt know when they filled out the loyalty survey that two specific questions on it would be the most important, if they blended in with the long list of questions that leads to different decisions than if they knew 27 and 28 were so important\n\n- How does he interact with his family (ie mother, father, and brother)?\n\t- is his mom crazy?\n\t\t- at first thought she was crazy, but can understand how those ideas can be ingrained, cognitive dissonance later when her ideals were questions\n\t- understood his brothers decision to join the army\n\t- more indifferent to his dad\n\t- sympathetic to his dad, both have a sense of helplessness, in different contexts\n\t\t- father wants to help ichiros mother but cant\n\t\t- ichiro is struggling with identity\n\t- ichiros mom commits suicide, father survives\n\t\t- sense of relief betwen ichiro and his father, very sad\n\t\t- family divided by one person's radical views\n\t\t- father didnt have a strong belief one way or another, sympathetic to mom\n\t- what makes his mom irrational?\n\t\t- refusal to acknowledge japans defeat, comes off as crazy to ichiro\n\t\t- stubbornness, unwavering views\n\t\t- believes to the end that her family back home is lying, being coerced\n\t- do you feel sympathetic to the mother?\n\t\t- during funeral when family friend gives speech about who she was, see how much she's changed since moving to the us\n\t\t- went through trauma of being interned\n\t\t- similar to today, relatives that have cultivated radical political views...is it their fault?\n\t- they were there to find work, make money, then war happened, stuck\n\t\t- original intention very different from what they ended up getting\n\t\t- makes you feel sympathetic for mother, many things out of her control\n\t- \"she thought she was doing right\"\n\n- How did his family experience the war?\n\t- alrdy talked about\n\n- How does postwar American society treat him and \"no no boys\"? How does the Japanese American community treat them?\n\t- ichirio is excluded, looked down on, stigmatized\n\t- theres even a nickname!\n\t- no no boys were responsible for reception of japanese americans in general?\n\t\t- yes yes boys feel that no noboys tarnished their reputation\n\t\t- scapegoat\n\t- \"life is like a coat rack without pegs, only you think there are, hang it, falls down, pick it back up, drop it again\"\n\t- lets compare ichiro and kenji more extensively\n\n- What tensions can we observe in this novel?

What can we say about their citizenship and identity?\n\t- although nissei were american citizens, they were interned based on national origin\n\t- in the end ichiro feels that kenjis service was futile\n\t- yes yes boys get put on a pedestal\n\t- kenji realizes that but the glow will go away, and will be viewed as japanese americans in the end\n\t- ichiro has more opportunities than kenji does\n\t- no no boys are looked down on, aka theyre treated like racial minorities already are, so whats changed even\n\t- \"the army didnt do anything about his face to make him look more american\"\n\t- yes yes boys have a spotlight but in the end they will be treated as racial minorities when they take off their uniform\n\t- \n\n- When the experiences of Japanese Americans vary so much, would it still make sense to talk about the \"history of Japanese Americans\"?\n\t- like in the previous question, kenji knew theyd be boiled down to japanese americans\n\t- is this line of thinking perpetuating that\n\t- differences in japanese americans\n\t\t- generational differences\n\t\t- mindsets\n\t\t- intent for going to america\n\t\t- yes yes vs no no\n\t\t- how internment treated them\n\t\t- how the war treated them\n\t\t- location in us, east coast, west coast, hawaii\n\t- there are still first generation japanese americans coming to the us today, very different situations\n\t\t- nisei students on campus now, but like different kind of second generation\n\t- kenjis father, one of the only people in the book thats actually happy, embraced america and tried to live life there to its fullest, complete opposite of ichiros mom who couldnt accept america\n\n\njapan today is like the third largest country in acception of immigrants\nno immigration visa, govt sees those people as sojourners (temp resident), dont appear in statistics as immigrants\n\n##### assignment\nsecond assignment for this class  - paper \n1100 1200 words on no no boy\ndiscussing how japanese americans experiences ww2 and its aftermath\nmust have an argument\ninclude topics issues weve discussed in class\n\n[[JAPN208 Essay 2 planning]]\n\u003e [!NOTE] Assignment 2\n\u003e Write a **single-spaced, 1,100- to 1,200-word paper** on John Okada’s _No No Boy_, discussing how Japanese Americans experienced World War II and its aftermath. Your paper should not be a simple summary of the novel.

he has a crazy red horse in dynasty warriors\n- poetry as proof\n\t- mentions the story of ying ying as proof these events occured\n\t- seen in this genre a lot\n- \"He thinks he can overthrow the Tang\"\n\t- portrayed in og story as some local skirmish, here its a huge conflict\n\t- not supposed to think he could actually overthrow the dynasty probably but used for dramatic effect\n- one monk, **Fa-ts'ung**, steps up from the back and says no we can fight\n\t- this monk had a rugged history but became a monk for salvation\n\t- many at the time believed that this is what monks were like, people who had criminal pasts and became monks to evade punishment\n\t- he thinks that if they can intimidate the people outside the gates they can get them to scatter because most are just there to follow the mutiny; no structure\n\t- he's bloodthirsty\n\t- its giving dynasty warriors 8 xl\n\t- wheres student chang anyways?\n- \"a full eight feet\"\n\t- focus on character description\n\t- tendency towards \"grotesque dimensions\"\n\t- huge odd heroes\n\t- describes other monks as rugged but not as ferocious\n\t- describes the rebel chief guy and his troops similarly\n- need to use wit to defeat the rebels\n\t- fatsung tries to reason with them\n- fatsung berates them and starts fighting\n- taunting\n- skipping ahead a little\n- common trope in these stories, \"A clashing sound was heard. Was the monk dead?\"\n\t- brief increase in tension\n\t- that part was prose, then goes into poetry, then we go back to the monk defending himself\n- nothing can defeat fatsung\n- fighting tension in these scenes similar to \"sexual tension in other stories\"\n\t- \"weird thing to say but we'll see\"\n- lots more fighting\n- ends up in a draw, decides to enact another plan\n\t- fatsung breaks through the lines\n\t- \"Perhaps I shouldn't say this -- he's exactly like / A cock having just / Emerged from a cunt.\"\n\t- here we see the vulgarity part\n- Flying Tiger Sun (the rebel chief guy) makes demands\n- Fatsung is fleeing\n- Flying Tiger Sun has big ideas, trying to gain resources to gain forces\n- Madam Ts'ui hears about these demands and faints\n- Ying-ying says dont worry about me I'll give myself up\n\t- filial piety\n\t- \"You must not let others be harmed just so that i may be saved from shame\"\n- dont know what to do\n- yingying decides she'll jump from the steps and give herself up when someone laughs and claps his hands\n\t- here comes the hero of the story\n\t- \"A young scholar matchless in beauty\"\n\t- Chang\n\t- clear he is unable to fight anyone, frail\n\t- says he can defeat them, has a plan\n- in the midst we get an argument about Buddhism and Confucianism\n\t- life and death and karma and fate and stuff, what if we did something bad to these rebels in a past life and this is karma\n\t- our spirit is our true self our body is but a temporary abode\n\t- possessions must be left behind, its fine if the temple burns \n\t- then start talking about Confucianism\n\t- charitable person loves humanity, would want to remove this threat\n\t- anyways he's stalling to give away his plan\n- trying to get with ying ying leveraging his plan\n\t- \"But when this is done, You mustn't start treating me like a stranger again\"\n- madam ts'ui says that she will see him as a son and he gives up his plan\n\t- gonna tell them that theyll give up ying ying\n\t- then Chung his gonna call in his connections to defeat the rebels\n\t- deus ex machina\n\t- he gives the letter to Fatsung (hed already given him the letter before he started fighting and broke through) and he gives the letter to the guy (this is next chapter also) and then the besties come in and quell the rebels and save them\n\nthoughts\n- the way monks are seen changes the reading\n\t- Chung calls them out as being basically the same as the people outside the walls\n- the way Fatsung was portrayed seems more heroic than Chung\n- what was the point of the religious argument that happened\n\t- hes making fun of them\n- his plan is basically writing a nice email\n- anticlimactic\n\t- adds to the humor of it\n- masculinity presented differently, and in different ways\n- ying ying's character in this adaptation\n\t- portrayed in negative light \"almost mary sue\"\n\t- very conflicted, reasonably, in a tough situation\n\t- being presented with no flaws\n- liked how ying ying was presented in the og story better\n\t- makes her seem even worse here, passive \n\t- she had a fairly reasonable plan for the situation and Chung waves it away as being emotional and

Commander for the Allied Powers\n\t- big role in creating american occupation in japan\n\t- in japan, us preserved most existing govt institutions, us forces ruled japan indirectly through those institutions\n\t- in okinawa, us ruled directly by establishing govt there\n\t- american occupation of korea was similar to occupation of okinawa\n- Emperor's divinity rejected\n\t- until end of war japanese ppl were told emperor was a divine being\n\t- created sense of unity of empire\n\t- american occupation, especially MacArthur, rejected this idea of divine being\n\t- famous picture of Macarthur with Emperor Hirohito\n\t- ![[Pasted image 20221101142146.png]]\n\t- just a dude\n\t- height makes hirohito look diminutive\n\t- MacArthur wanted this picture published to show people he was just a dude\n\t- there was also attempt by japanese media at the time to humanize the emperor; show him with his family\n\t- \"I dont think people before this really believed the emperor was divine, but american occupation confirmed this\"\n- Women granted voting right, 1945\n\t- universal suffrage realized through this\n\t- universal male suffrage was realized 20 years earlier\n\t- also at this time, people from colonies, korea, taiwan, living in japan, had japanese nationality, citizenship, until after 1945 they were deprived this right\n\t\t- classified as aliens/foreigners\n- Workers granted right to organize, 1945\n\t- right to strike, illegal before 1945\n\t\t- american occupation forces changed this\n\t\t- remember this is all the doing of american occupation's influence\n- Political prisoners released\n\t- communists, socialists, also liberals and pacifists\n\t- Peace Preservation Law of 1925 targeted these people\n\t- anyone who tries to change economic system of private ownership (capitalism)\n\t- japanese people welcomed the release of these prisoners\n\t- at early stages of occupation communists were seen as almost heroes\n- Tokyo Trial, 1946-1948\n\t- japanese war criminals were tried\n\t- different levels, class A the heaviest - crime against humanity\n\t- about 100 class A war criminals arrested - top figures in the military, etc\n\t- about 15 sentenced to death/executed\n\t- many eventually released/avoided indictment\n\t- americans believed japanese war criminals could be rehabilitated as american allies\n\t- one of those release class A criminals later became prime minister - Nobosuke Kishi\n- War collaborators purged\n\t- lost their jobs and stuff\n\t- not just military; journalists, company bigwigs involved in ammo manufacturing/etc\n- Constitution of Japan, 1946\n\t- Unarmed peace\n\t- Popular sovereignty\n\t\t- in Meiji constitution, emperor was sovereign\n\t\t- in new constitution, the people were sovereign, like in america\n\t- Fundamental human rights\n\t- Gender equality\n\t\t- fought for by Beate Sirota Gordon\n- Land reform, 1947\n\t- one of the most fundamental reforms americans implemented\n\t- america bought land from landlords very cheaply\n\t- sold that land to peasants very cheaply\n\t- purpose to create independent farmers instead of tenant farmers\n\t\t- tenant farmers would work on a landlords land and pay the landlord rent\n\t\t- landlords wouldnt have to work just collect rent\n\n##### Constitution of the Empire of Japan, 1889\n- The old, Meiji era constitution\n- preamble\n\t- \"We\"\n\t- \"Our present subjects\"\n- article 1\n\t- \"The Empire of Japan shall be reigned over and governed by a line of Emperors unbroken for ages eternal.\"\n- article 29\n\t- \"Japanese subjects shall, within the limits of the law, enjoy the liberty of speech, ...\"\n- reads like the emperor created this and gave it to the people\n\n##### Constitution of Japan, 1946\n- preamble\n\t- \"We the Japanese people, acting through our duly elected representatives ...\"\n\t- \"the sovereign power resides with the people\"\n- presented as if the people wrote this constitution (but yknow, written by americans)\n- article 1\n\t- \"The Emperor shall be the symbol of the State and of the unity of the People, deriving his position from the will of the people with whom resides sovereign power.\"\n- article 4\n\t- \"he shall nor have powers related to the government\"\n- emperor is just a symbol, with no poliitcal power\n- emperor system still exists today in japan\n- opinion polls: \u003e70% of japanese pop support this emperor system today\n- constitutional monarchy\n- notable articles\n\t- 9 - renounce war, military forces will not be maintained, unarmed peace\n\t\t- ordered rearmament of japan in 1950 when cold war tensions rose\n\t\t- national police reserve created 1950\n\t- 13 - life, liberty, pursuit of happiness\n\t\t- easily see american influence\n\t- 24 - gender equality and marriage\n\t\t- made to prevent arranged marriage\n\t\t- today, same sex marriage being discussed, article 24 is used to oppose bc it says \"both sexes\"\n\t\t\t- historical context is different\n\t\t\t- majority of japan in favor of same sex marriage today\n\t\t\t- still not legal\n\t- 25 - promote social welfare and security\n\t\t- very progressive article at the time\n\t\t- mentioned peoples social rights, not just political and economic\n\t\t- govt is responsible for maintaining the livable standard of the people\n\n##### American Effort to Make a New Constitution\namericans didnt like the meiji constitution not enough democracy very eager to change it\n- Government Section within Occupation forces asked to prepare a draft, February 1946\n- \"MacArthur draft\" presented to Japanese government, February 1946\n- Japanese government completes revisions, April 1946\n- Privy Council approves the draft, June 1946\n\t- advisory council for the

the Imperial Diet ends, March 1947\n\t- house of reps and peers are part of the imperial diet\n\t- reps were popularly elected, peers were not\n- Constitution of Japan becomes effective, May 1947; House of Peers replaced by House of Councilors\n\n##### The Only Woman in the Room\ndiscussion questions\n- Who is Sirota Gordon? How does she identify herself?\n- How does she narrate her cross-border movement? \n\t- What categories does she use? (\"As a woman, as a foreigner, as a white woman, etc\")\n- What advantages (or privileges) and disadvantages does she experience in japan during American occupation?\n- How does she view Japanese society and Japanese women?\n\t- in previous classes students said she is condescending, similar to Bird in [[Unbeaten Tracks In Japan]]\n\t- \"I want you to be nice with her\"\n\t- think about her experience in 1940s 1950s as a woman\n- Conservatives in Japan insist that the Japanese constitution was \"imposed\" by the Americans against the will of the Japanese. Does Sirota Gordon's narrative reinforce this discourse or challenge it?","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.436918306Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-11-02-CHIN309":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-11-02 Wednesday]] 17:03:03\ndescription:: discussing [[The Injustice of Dou E]]\n\n##### Yuan Dynasty 1279 - 1368\none of the shortest dynasties\n\ntoday talking about a play from this dynasty, a drama\n\n##### Drama (*za ju*)\n- different type of genre than the one we spoke of previously\n- had existed before but entered its hayday during yuan dynasty\n- usually 4 acts, sometimes 8, 16 acts\n- usually have a happy ending in the form of a reunion\n- mixed mode\n\t- poems and prose\n\t- poetry and songs could become popular and circulate on their own outside of the play\n- role types\n\t- Sheng - Main Male Protagonist\n\t\t- often a young literati\n\t\t- scholar off to seek his fortunes usually in the exams\n\t\t- Student Chang was a Sheng character in [[Story of Ying-ying]]\n\t- Dan - Main Female Protagonist\n\t- Hue - Painted Face\n\t\t- color often indicating personality\n\t\t- a set personality type\n\t- Chou - Clown\n\t\t- comedic figure\n\t\t- antagonist usually\n\t\t- also a painted face character\n\n##### Guan Hanqing, 1220-1307?\n- wrote dramas\n- wrote in a vernacular style, how people spoke at the time\n- credited with \u003e 65 plays\n- about a third of the art from this period survived, his is the same\n- famous for writing plays about women in lower social strata\n- often a scholar\n- some argue he came up with this genre of drama in the first place(?)\n\nFeatures of this play\n- Once actor sings per scene\n\n##### [[The Injustice of Dou E]]\ndough-uh\n- guy named Dou sells his daughter in order to go to the capital and take the imperial exam\n- daughter marries the money lender's son, becomes widowed\n- two guys extort the money lender one day, want to marry her and her daughter\n- guy wants to kill money lender and take Dou E, he poisons soup and accidentally kills his father, frames Dou E and takes her to court she gets executed\n- Dou E's father comes back and her ghost talks to him and wants revenge\n- supernatural stuff happens after Dou E's execution\n\t- 3 year drought\n\t- it snows in midsummer\n\nModern Interpretations\n- Snow in Midsummer\n\t- done in oregon like 4 years ago\n\t- english interpretation\n- Teochew Opera: _\n\t- another interpretation\n\t- in china\n\t- preserves the muscial parts better than english version\n\t- instrumentation\n\t- more traditional interpretation\n\nsome considerations\n- fascinating window into contemporary culture\n\t- things we see relate to contemporary norms\n\t- presented as if assumed/non controversial\n\t- presented as criticism\n- obligations that parents have towards children vs obligations children have towards parents\n\t- theme we've seen throughout class, explored in this play\n- ideas about medicine\n\t- a quack doctor attacks the money lender\n- justice\n\t- not an accurate depiction, but gives some ideas of what popular perception of justice looked like\n\t- what is justice\n\t- how is evidence procured, found\n\t- what evidence is acceptable\n\t- different layers of justice - karmic retribution\n- the supernatural\n\t- people loved ghost stories!\n\t- a trope that the ghosts of wrong people come back to set right the thing that was done to them\n\nwhat did you think\u003e?\n- idk i didnt read but what did others think\n- when daughter contacts father as a ghost hes not that frightened he accepts it quickly\n- reading this doesnt have the same affect as seeing it played out probably does\n- not sure if it was intentionally humorous, but there were funny parts\n\t- it was probably meant to be funny, meant to be entertaining\n\n\n##### Looking at the text\n- often begin with a prologue\n\t- opportunity for the actors and actresses to lay out the premise of the play\n\t- not really a main male protagonist, maybe her father\n\t- prologue starts with mistress ts'ai, explaining how Scholar Dou sells away his daughter\n\t- then Scholar Dou comes in and talks about how hes poor and wants to take exam\n- they go through the deal making\n\t- \"not atypical for how deal making would have happened\"\n\t- dou is being humble but like his daughter would be marrying down because money lenders dont have a very high social ranking\n\t- dou would probably have been from the gentry, socially higher, but hes poor like super poor and this is his last resort probably\n\t- he goes off and takes exams and disappears\n- act 1\n\t- starts with doctor Lu\n\t- not a good doctor / not a well respected member of society\n\t- shows Guan Hanqing highlighting socially low ranking people\n\t- mistress tsai comes back and gives more context\n\t\t- \"I am Mistress Ts'ai\"\n\t\t- everyone keeps introducing themselves\n\t- its been 13 years since Dou E became her daughter\n\t\t- she's been widowed for 3 years\n\t- doctor tries to strangle her, but Chang (Old Chang) and his son (Donkey Chang) rush in to save her\n\t- changs want reward for saving her - marrying her and the daughter\n\t\t- \"all sorts of reasons something like this shouldnt be done\"\n\t\t- when someone is a widow, common idea that they shouldnt be remarried\n\t- now Dou E introduces herself and gives the premise of the story (for like the fourth time)\n\t- she laments about her life through song/poem\n\t\t- common trope - young woman becomes on the verge of death because of sorrow\n\t\t- \"note that these plays would be relatively slow\" songs were slow\n\t\t- singing would have been slower and drawn out, prose would be enunciated loudly and performed slower than conversational speed but not as slow as the songs\n\t- now we get another recap when mistress tell Dou E what happened\n\t\t- Dou E does not want this but mistress tsai says theres not much they can do about it\n\t\t- Dou E uses social norms to say why it would be crazy for both of them to be married, for mistress tsai because shes already old and for Dou E shes a widow\n\t\t- Dou E is loyal to her husband that passed\n\t- dou e tells the changs no its not happening and they r mad\n- act 2\n\t- donkey chang plans to poison mistress tsai in order to coerce dou e to marry him which doesnt really make sense but alr\n\t\t- he goes to get poison from dr Lu and uses the blackmail that he saw him try to strangle mistress tsai\n\t\t- dr lu is scared hes gonna get in trouble and decides to close the shop and sell rat poison in another town\n\t- Old Chang ends up eating the soup and dies\n\t\t- hes dead!\n\t\t- donkey chang tries to frame dou e for this and they send for the magistrate\n\t- prefect enters\n\t\t- like the doctor whose patients end up dead, the prefect isnt the best at his job either\n\t\t\t- when a superior comes to inspect he says hes under the weather and stays home\n\t\t- donkey chang accuses dou e\n\t- how evidence is produced\n\t\t- \"people are mean worms. if you dont beat them, they will not confess\"\n\t\t- one way evidence is extracted is with torture/beatings\n\t\t- we see later this prefect is not doing his job properly\n\t- dou e doesnt think mistress ts'ai can survive being beaten, so she makes up a confession\n\t\t- she wouldnt get married for her mother in law but she will confess to murder to save her from a beating\n\t- prefect says oki we will execute you tmr\n\t\t- when sentencing someone to death theyre supposed to take it to the emperor and stuff and give time and not do it just tmr\n\t\t- so this is bad\n\t\t- \"Injustice escapes not the eyes of Heaven and Earth\"\n- execution scene\n\t- one of the more popular scenes to reenact and stuf\n\t- Dou E's chance to claim her innonence to the universe\n\t\t- she asks to hang a white silk, and if blood splashes the silk when shes executed then its a sign of injustice bc if heaven exists then there will be evidence of her injustice or smth\n\t\t- it does happens just like she predicted\n- act 4 (idk where act 3 started i guess i missed it)\n\t- Dou E's father comes back to town by coincidence\n\t\t- he passed the exam on first try and is now a high ranking official that inspects corrupt officials and unjust courts\n\t\t- ironic!\n\t- he has excuses for not being around whatvr\n\t- he ends up in town to inspect\n\t\t- as he goes to bed one night after reading her criminal case file the ghost of Dou E approaches him\n\t- Dou E's ghost gets his attention and tries to show him how the case was unjust n get him to investigate\n\t- we r runnin out of time skipping ahead\n\t- they find the doctor and chang and all the bad stuff that happens\n\t- he corrects the injustice and thats the end! shout out to hard working officials\n\nthoughts?\n- dou e is trying to do whats obligated of her (filial piety etc) and it doesnt work out for her until karmic retribution after","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.436918306Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-11-02-CSCI243":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-11-02 Wednesday]] 11:06:15\ndescription:: even more complexity analysis\n\ntired\nif theres a gas leak at muscarelle area can i skip my math class\n\nhe wrapped up whatever example thing we ended last class with\nanyways\n\n##### Complexity for nested loops\nA loop runs through a certain number of times which corresponds to summing whatever ops each iteration performs.

every chapter will begin with a couplet\n\t- end with some form of formulaic phrase \"to see what happens next read the next chapter\"\n- standard convention for a narrative figure to interject\n- by 1770-1780s when the dream of the red chamber comes out, novels are more respected\n\n##### The Water Margin\n- or Outlaws of the March\n- or All Men are Brothers\n- One of the Four Great Classical Novels\n\t- other three are Journey to the West, Dream of the Red Chamber, and Romance of the Three Kingdoms\n- many versions of the book, many accepted as worth reading\n\t- in one version the bandits are granted amnesty\n\t- in one version the character dreams they are all executed at the end (we are reading this one)\n\t- etc\n\t- why does the editor of our particular version decide to change the ending?\n- Shi Nai'an 1296?-1372?\n\t- largely attributed with creating the water margin\n\t- may have edited it\n- 108 Bandits\n\t- 36 Heavenly Spirits, 72 Earthly Demons\n\t- novel goes over these with varying significance\n\t- 36 heavenly spirits are the main characters\n- Character driven and Episodic\n\t- many characters\n\t- almost no discussion of romance, unlike many of the novels written at the time\n\t- constructed of a bunch of small stories\n\t- we get the backstories of all these different people\n- Bi-partite structure\n\t- split into two parts\n\t- first ab the backstories and stuf\n\t- second part they are pardoned and fight for the govt\n\t- second part is usually less popular\n- Wu Song\n\t- one of the most influential characters\n\t- The Water Margin becomes very influential in Japan\n\t- spurred a number of rewrites\n\t- A scandalous rewrite\n\t\t- The Plum and the Golden Vase\n\t\t- a pornographic satire of society in the ming dynasty\n\t\t- takes part of the story of Wu song and turns it into a whole novel\n\t\t- shows how people find this text interesting and rewrite it\n- Illustrated Editions\n\t- people love looking at pictures!\n\t- certain editions illustrations become popular as trading cards\n- Jin Shengtan and the goals of fiction\n\t- or: Are the Bandits \"Loyal and Righteous?\"\n\t- Jin Shengtan was a famous scholar at the end of ming dynasty(?~)\n\t- offered annotated versions of famous works\n\t- thinks that the water margin is one of the best novels ever written\n\t- true authorship is something that can only be done by sages and the emperor\n\t- in his edited version, he takes out the words Loyal and Righteous\n\t- cant call these characters righteous because they are murderers and plunderers\n\t- takes away the happy ending where they are forgiven\n\t- we are reading the version with his commentary\n\n##### [[Wu Sung Beats the Tiger]]\n- \"not set up with the narrative logic we'd expect today\"\n- wu sung is gonna go visit his brothers and he has to \n- \"{Club: the fifth time}\"\n\t- first of Jin Shengtan's comments\n\t- he wants us to pay attention to when the author mentions his club; why is this?\n- everything is spoiled it says like in 4 different places on this page that wu sung is gonna fight a tiger\n\t- the important part isnt the surprise, it's about enjoying and understanding How the story is told\n- fascinating to see what jin shengtan thinks\n\t- shows us what is important to this figure from this time in the past\n\t- not all of the annotations are transformative or add much but still pretty interesting/funny\n\t- these notes were inserted directly into the text between sentences\n- \"Then we see the shop owner bring three bowls {Extraordinary writing.}, ...\"\n\t- whys that extraordinary writing\n\t- prob drawing attention to the use of counting\n\t- also said it was extraordinary earlier when the sign said no more than three bowls\n\t- No Crossing After Three Bowls\n\t- interesting how he emphasizes certain seemingly mundane parts\n- \"{Ordinary folks are not worth mentioning}\"\n- \"{The author switches to another way of writing. I cannot help but roar in laughter reading this}\"\n\t- switches from more flowery prose to more dialogue focused\n- govt delegates the killing of the loose tiger to local hunters with punishment of flogging if they dont\n\t- satire on how ming govt cant control anything, cant even hunt down this tiger\n- wu sung is literate enough to be able to read the sign warning of tiger\n\t- sign says almost verbatim what the barkeep said to him\n\t\t- \"{Extraordinary writing.}\"\n- then he comes to a temple and finds another sign about this tiger\n\t- \"{Extraordinary writing.}\"\n- doesnt specify precise year/date this is happening, \"such a day in such a month of such a year\"\n\t- sometime in the early part of 12th century\n- starts to believe there really is a tiger and maybe he's making a mistake\n- starts to think he should go back to the wine shop\n\t- {\"with this sign of weakness, wu sungs valor is brought out even more clearly\"}\n\t- fears ridicule/being looked down upon and decides to keep going\n- keeps going\n- he starts feeling real drunk and finds a nice rock to take a nap, and then the tiger jumps out! the reader is frightened to death!\n- he grabs his club and now they will face off\n- jin shengtan's commentary adds to slowing down the narrative and adding suspense\n\t- extremely long comment before the fight adds suspense\n\t- very interesting way to change this reading\n\t- hes just saying wow youd never see a tiger fight a man in real life\n\t- Shi Nai'an has so embodied the nature of a tiger that in writing about one has become one\n- this fight is so enthralling that jin shengtan sees a green bean (real)\n- tigers cant see well behind them and wu sung has a one up on him\n- wu sung is dodging the tiger is roaring\n- he swings for the tiger and misses and breaks his club!!!! all those mentions of a club lead up to this\n- \"{We are absolutely stunned and can hardly dare read on... the reader is so frightened that his heart and liver have jumped out of his mouth.}\"\n- he wrestles with it and pummels it until the tiger eventually dies\n- wu sung decides to take the tiger and drag it down the ridge but he cant because hes so tired\n- he rests then realizes what if another tiger shows up so he will leave and then come back\n- two more tigers come out! \"{Extraordinary writing that will frighten people to death}\"\n- its just two hunters dressed as tigers\n- we get more detail from these hunters the tribulations that the locals have gone through to try and kill this tiger\n- wu sung shows them the dead tiger and its craaazy hes craaazy!\n- after this wu sung is welcomed as a hero and stuff but the excerpt ends here\n\nthoughts\n- feels like a screenplay\n\t- descriptive in a way that it feels like you can picture whats happening\n\t- story beats feel like a play\n\t- elements are set up and used\n\t- many of these stories circulated orally prior to being written down  which may contribute to that feeling\n- violence\n\t- not much besides when hes pummeling the tiger\n\t- this is one of the more tame stories in the book\n- the commentary\n\t- interesting\n\t- adds to the story\n\n\n\nnext time discussing a scene from the dream of the red chamber\n\"very different from this\"","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.436918306Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-11-07-CSCI243":{"title":"","content":"tags:

17:00:42\ndescription:: discussing [[A Burial Mound for Flowers]]\n\n##### Dream of the Red Chamber\n- aka The Story of the Stone\n- most famous novel written in china\n- pinnacle of chinese vernacular literature\n- one of the best stories ever written\n- written by a guy anonymously first 80 chapters, finished by another guy 40 more chapters\n- \"so complex and so peopled with major and minor characters would be futile to summarize in a couple paragraphs\"\n- circulated among elites after its publications in 1750s-1760s\n- many notes by contemporary readers about the novel\n- printed in 1791\n\n##### Cao Xuequin 1715?-1763?\n- author\n- born in nanjing\n- family was members of the white banner (military/govt)\n- ancestors were very important people\n\t- grandfather one of the emperors closest friends\n\t- grandmother was the emperors wetnurse\n\t- grandfather was the scholar for compilation of complete poems of the Qing(?) dynasty\n- some think this was the reason Cao wrote the novel\n\t- to recapture some of the glory his family lost\n- novel starts with a wealthy family and follows their downfall\n\t- some read this as autobiographical\n- novel wasnt published in his lifetime\n- fundamental differences between first 80 and last 40 chapters\n\n##### The Basic Plot\n- a stone requests the opportunity to live in the mundane world and is granted this wish, becomes a human\n- baby boy is born with jade in his mouth\n- thats why its called story of the stone\n- this part isnt so relevant after the beginning\n- but thats neat\n\n##### Question of Authorship\n- offers a window into meaning of the story\n- novels were written anonymously / with pseudonyms\n- by the time this novel comes out its much more respected to be doing\n- ex when the water margin was written 400 years prior, not so respected\n\n##### \"Redology\"\n- works about rereading the text\n- \"Approaches to Teaching The Story of The Stone\"\n\t- series of essays published regarding teaching this novel at the collegiate level\n\t- many ways to read the novel, many things to takeaway\n\t- like most important novels i guess\n- has also been adapted into tv shows\n\n##### Over 400 Characters\n- a lot of characters!\n- only ~30 that are really significant/important\n- main trifecta\n\t- Jia Baoyu - the stone/main character\n\t- Lin Daiyu - Baoyus cousin/ideal love\n\t- Xue Baochai - Baoyus cousin/eventual wife\n\n##### Reception\n- Zhou Qi\n\t- \"takes human feelings and social relations and locates them in the world of powder and rouge, the world of women...\"\n\t- well received among women\n\n##### Things to consider\n- hows family presented\n\t- relationship between family members\n\t- between Jia Baoyu and his father/grandmother/etc\n\t- between family members and the servants\n- how servants names are treated in translation\n\t- reasons to translate the servants names and not the main characters\n- elite society and cultural capital\n- status and privilege as a consort to the emperor\n- cultural implication of reading within a text\n- nature of orality vs reading\n\n##### Burial Mound for Flowers\n- jia baoyu's destiny is to be a high ranking official\n- close relationship with emperor\n- building a garden for eldest daughter(?)\n\t- she thinks its a waste to have a wonderful garden that no one can use but her\n\t- wants to give this garden over to her cousins including jia baoyu\n- father isnt super down with it\n- jia baoyu is called to meet with his father\n- um i dont think im summarizing this right i missed some stuff\n- weird stuff with servants\n- names of servants have been translated but family members names arent\n\t- ex Bombarding Scent, Gold Bangle\n\t- dad is like, who is Bombarding Scent?\n\t- baoyu named the servants\n\t- get the feeling that these servants are subhuman to the family, their identity isnt constant\n- father concerned that baoyu isnt studying for the imperial exams\n\t- hes gonna spend all his time in the garden slacking off\n- baoyu is like 16-17 or smth\n- planning to move into the garden\n\t- people are choosing places\n\t- picking auspicious dates to move in - thats important!\n- people get bored\n\t- after moving in to the garden its all playing games and reading and painting and writing poems\n\t- not a lot of studying for the exams going on\n\t- idyllic life of leisure\n- shows some poems\n\t- theyre not that good idk\n- jia baoyu gets so upset and bored after a while he has a servant find him reading materials\n\t- but not classics he should be studying, he wants plays and poems and stuff\n\t- servant finds him [[Master Dong's Western Chamber Romance]]\n\t- starts reading this book\n\t- its shown that this is illicit behavior, not what he should be wasting his time on\n- lin daiyu comes up to him and says what are you reading and she finds out\n\t- she reads it too\n\t- dangerous!\n\t- \"theres a whole world of love she doesnt know about\"\n- gust of wind passes and a bunch of petals fall off a tree and jin baoyu says we should dump these into the river and watch them float down and lin daiyu says no what an ignominous way for these flowers to end we should bury the petals\n\t- thats where the title comes from and froeshadows lin daiyus death! rip\n- intertextuality plays a big part in this\n\t- the mention of the western chamber - illicit relationships and vernacular culture\n\t- this book was written for fancy literary people\n\t- eventually escaped elite society and became something everyone enjoyed\n- jia baoyu represented as

To prove a property S(X) of a recursively defined structure X, it is sufficient to prove that S(X) is true for the basis structures of X and that $S(Y_1) \\wedge S(Y_2) \\wedge \\ldots \\wedge S(Y_k) \\rightarrow S(X)$, where X is constructed from $Y_1, Y_2, \\ldots, Y_k$.\n\nex. Let the height of a tree be the number of nodes on the longest path from the root to a leaf (note that height of $\\emptyset$ is 0). Prove that for any binary tree with $n$ nodes and height $h$, $n \\leq 2^h - 1$.\n\n##### Proof by inducting on height\nBasis step: consider the empty tree. obviously $n = 0$ and $h = 0$ which satisfies the inequality\n\nI.H.: assume for any binary tree with height up to $k$, the inequality holds\n\nI.S.: consider binary tree with height $k + 1$\n![[Pasted image 20221116201147.png]]\nassume that the left subtree has $n_1$ nodes with height $h_1$ an and the right subtree has $n_2$ nodes with height $h_2$. thus $k + 1 = max(h_1, h_2) + 1$\n\nsince $h_1, h_2 \\leq k$, then by IH, $n_1 \\leq 2^{h_1} - 1$ and $n_2 \\leq 2^{h_2} - 1$\nso $n = n_1 + n_2 + 1$\n$\\leq ( 2^{h_1} - 1) + ( 2^{h_2} - 1) + 1$\n$\\leq 2^{max(h_1, h_2) + 1} - 1 = 2^{k+1} - 1$\n\n\n##### Structural induction proof\nyeah that wasn't even the structural induction proof ok\n\nBasis step: consider the empty tree. obviously $n = 0$ and $h = 0$ which satisfies the inequality\n\nI.H.: Assume for two binary trees $T_1$ and $T_2$ the inequality holds.\n\nI.S.: We will prove that the inequality holds also for the tree built recursively from these two trees. This tree is built as a new root with $T_1$ and $T_2$ as its left and right subtrees.\n\nAssume that $T_1$ has $n_1$ nodes with height $h_1$ and $T_2$ has $n_2$ nodes with height $h_2$. Thus the hight of the new tree is $h = max(h_1, h_2) + 1$\n\nBy IH, $n_1 \\leq 2^{h_1} - 1$ and $n_2 \\leq 2^{h_2} - 1$.\nSo $n = n_1 + n_2 + 1$\n$\\leq ( 2^{h_1} - 1) + ( 2^{h_2} - 1) + 1$\n$\\leq 2^{max(h_1, h_2) + 1} - 1 = 2^{k+1} - 1$\n\n\nNotice the two proofs are almost identical\nStructural induction simply removes the need to induct on a particular variable, instead using the recursive definition as the step between I.H. and I.S.","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.436918306Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-11-11-F22-Week-11":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-11-29 Tuesday]] 22:07:32\ndescription:: ⬜ \n\nnext: [[2022-11-18 F22 Week 12]]\n\n[[2022-11-07 Monday]]\n- [[2022-11-07 CSCI243]]\n- [[2022-11-07 MATH211]]\n- [[2022-11-07 CHIN309]]\n[[2022-11-08 Tuesday]] was election day oh yeah thats why there was no class\n[[2022-11-09 Wednesday]]\n- [[2022-11-09 CSCI243]]\n- [[2022-11-09 MATH211]]\n- [[2022-11-09 CHIN309]]\n[[2022-11-10 Thursday]]\n- [[2022-11-10 JAPN208]]\n[[2022-11-11 Friday]]\n- [[2022-11-11 CSCI243]]\n- [[2022-11-11 MATH211]]\n\n```dataview\nTABLE description FROM \"Fleeting Notes\"\nWHERE file.day \u003e= date(2022-11-07) AND file.day \u003c= date(2022-11-11)\nSORT file.day ASC\n```","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.436918306Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-11-11-MATH211":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-11-29 Tuesday]] 22:24:11\ndescription:: digital signal processing\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.436918306Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-11-14-CHIN309":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-11-14 Monday]] 17:00:09\ndescription:: discussing [[Journey to the West]]\n\nlast time discussed dream of the red chamber and [[A Burial Mound for Flowers]] from it\n\nthis week diving deeper into one novel, [[Journey to the West]]\nlooking at one chapter today and another on wednesday\n\nquite a bit different from the other novels weve seen\nmore fantastical, focuses more on religious ideas\ntakes place during tang dynasty\nwritten during the ming dynasty, 16th century\n\n##### Buddhism in the Tang Dynasty\nhow buddhism existed only marginally related to how its used in the novel\nexisted in china since approx 2nd c\nzen buddhism -

chaotic trickster with a lot of weaknesses to pair with his supernatural strengths, makes him a n interesting character\n- throughout the story theres part where their biggest hope is an angry monkey and it can get wild\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.436918306Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-11-14-CSCI243":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-11-14 Monday]] 11:06:08\ndescription:: solving problems recursively\n\nProblems solved recursively\nlecture 14\n\nHow can I break the problem into a number of smaller problems from which I can built it through the given properties?

Are there other ways of explaining the issues that he is addressing?\n\t- pretty accurate in what he predicted what might happen, criticism is using nations as unit of analysis, grouping together many different groups as one, talking about asia as a whole, over generalization\n\t- said communism wasnt really a threat, but wanted to promote trade, promoting global capitalism\n\t- japan as an outlier, model nation\n\t- anti conquest\n\t- no other opinions, especially from asia, could have included for example what a chinese diplomat/elite thought and countered those arguments\n\t- doesnt address dictatorships under capitalism\n\t- industrialization and capitalism leading to peaceful society - says thats the right way because thats how the us did it\n\nhow do you summarize the reading in a few words?\n- lots of assumptions\n- seemingly convincing\n- industrialization equals prosperity\n- communism not scary\n- american perspective","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.436918306Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-11-16-CHIN309":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting  \ncreation date: [[2022-11-16 Wednesday]] 16:57:02  \ndescription:: continuing [[Journey to the West]]\n\ninteresting chapter we read today (i didnt read it ops)  \n  \nmonday remote class on zoom we'll be discussing all the material weve covered in class  \n4th essay due friday \"but if you need extra time not an issue at all, turn it in when you can\"  \ninteresting!  \n  \ntext is very telling of a lot of late imperial chinese culture  \nthink about, what does this text tell us about china?\n\nthe monkey and the monk - abridged version of anthony whatevers translation\n\njust last year or so a new translation by julia lovell - monkey king\n\nuse these versions in the next part talking about other parts of the book we didnt read\n\n##### The rest of the novel\n- depictions of heaven\n\t- secondary characters all go through a fall that leads to them having to help the monk in his travels\n\t\t- sun wukong the monkey king attracts the attention of heaven\n\t\t- shows a representation of what heaven looks like\n\t- see a scene in the book of a remonstration in heaven similar to the  way the emperor would address the complaints of people \n\t\t- written in style called a memorial \n\t\t- emperor would respond saying what theyd do about this\n\t\t- this process shows up in the novel as how minor dieties go to the empire in heaven to complain about this monkey wreaking havoc\n\t\t- buddhist flavor\n\t\t- part of the justice making process of imperial china\n\t\t- move from vernacular prose to highly memorialized language in the book, very striking when reading, evokes a high level of authority\n\t- multiple memorials come to the emperor about sun wukong\n\t\t- next one is more informational, littany about sun wukong and talks about how hes struck all monkeys names from the underworlds registry to make them immortal\n\t- instead of sending an army after him, emperor sends out for sun wukong to have a conversation with him\n\t\t- plan is appeasement, give him a rank and bring him in so hes satisfied\n\t\t- they try to pacify him and give him basically the job of heavenly stableboy taking care of horses and hes happy about it but he realizes this is one of the lowest ranks and revolts then they give him a higher rank and it keeps going\n\t\t- eventually buddha comes in to intercede\n\t\t- shows that the buddha is above the emperor\n\t\t- he cant beat buddha hes imprisoned under a mountain end of the first part of the novel ~first 7 chapters out of ~100\n- tripitaka/the monk\n\t- difference between the real monk that sought the texts himself basically snuck out of the country and the monk in the novel who was actively sent out by the emperor\n\t- depending on where the monk goes hes welcomed as a representative of the great tang and in other places thats ignored\n\t- says a lot about ideas of the power of the dynasty; ming dynasty ideas of the cultural power of the tang dynasty\n\t- in the imperial period when something happens is super important; emperors duty to find that things accord with the calendar - monk should be sent out on an auspicious day\n\t- what do you think of these differences to the irl story? how would it change the story if tripitaka snuck out to make this journey?\n\t\t- dangerous at that time to write something ab going agianst the emperor\n\t\t- this version makes him seem more honorable righteous etc for being sent by the emperor\n\t\t- this version legitimizes his goal, sets him as a goody two shoes thats never done anything wrong\n\t\t- heaven is sanctioning his travels with giving him aid through his companions like sun wukong, if the emperor and the heavens have conflicting goals then thats dangerous to write about, would say something different ab the power of the emperor, divine right\n\n##### Discussing the reading\n- initial thoughts?\n\t- little more humorous than last class' reading\n\t- odd, off the wall\n\t- funny\n\t- monkey is very entertaining\n\t- reminiscent of (another story) uses a foreign land to show an unusal role for women\n- tension between the narrative and sex\n\t- the monk can be corrupted, rip away the purity he has\n\t- monk is given problems that typically faced by women, feminization of the character, needs to be saved\n- interesting narrative/conflict\n\t- if theres a country of only women how can there be babies born\n\t- theres a spring you drink from that makes you pregnant when you drink it\n\t- monkey gets sent off on a mission to find the opposite abortion water to fix some conflict in the plot\n\t- monkey traversing the universe the spring he has to go to is 3000 miles away very warped perspective of space\n\t- and warped perspective of time\n\t- shows how the journey is more important than the destination, the conflicts they go through is the important part\n\t- we know historically that this trip took 16 years\n- thoughts during this time period on birth and abortion\n\t- not necessarily seen as super negative\n\t- seen practically \n\t- birth control seen as something difficult to do anyways\n\n##### Where does the novel go from here\n- many arcs like this\n- novel has to figure out how to wrap up all these loose ends and bring them back to china\n- relationship to numerology, important part of the structure of the work\n\t- they have to go through a number of ordeals, which explains why sun wukong cant just jump around everywhere and get it done in a day\n\t- towards end of the book chapter 99 theres a discussion of all the different things tripitaka has gone through\n\t- starts with before he is born talks about his entire life\n\t- listed as ordeals\n\t- hes undergone 80 ordeals\n\t- this is a problem because 80 is not 9 times 9!\n\t- feels a little like breaking thr fourth wall\n\t- anyways cant just escort him back to china needs one more ordeal\n\t- ends up falling into an ocean, rescued by enormous turtle from an earlier chapter conflict with the turtle anyways thats the 81st ordeal\n\t- all the sutras gets dropped in the water and are damaged in the drying process, explaining why some sutras irl are damaged\n- getting their rewards\n\t- all the characters made different dieties\n\t- karmic reward bestowed upon them\n\n##### The book's impacts\n- the contents of the book has been very influential and used over and over\n\t- like greek mythology\n\t- structure not as important, was alrdy well established, the contents are whats important\n- how does this novel compare to novels today?\n\t- much more episodic\n\t\t- did circulate at its time as separate chapters\n\t- jokes are pretty crude\n\t- feels less bound as logic\n\t\t- theres usually rules and stuff like rules of magic systems\n\t\t- seems to be throwing stuff out there\n\t- goes beyond just monster of the day, monsters have moral backgrounds to them, daoist influence, like how the land of only women was used to explore concept of lust\n- other ways we can think of this novel\n\t- representations of religion, buddhism, daoism\n\t- representations of women\n- many sequels that came out almost immediately\n- video games that take from this novel\n\t- date back to early console games\n\t- Black Myth: Wukong is the next upcoming one\n\t- theres a lot!\n\t- the structure of the story contributes to its ability to be turned into a game\n- Lego Monkie Kid \n- wow theres a lot3333","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.436918306Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-11-16-CSCI243":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting  \ncreation date: [[2022-11-16 Wednesday]] 11:09:01  \ndescription:: solving problems recursively again\n\nsolving problems recursively\n\nex.

Since there is clearly no overlap between them, the total number of passwords is $P_6+P_7+P_8 = (36^6 −26^6 ) + (36^7 −26^7 ) + (36^8 −26^8 ) = 2,684,483,063,360$.","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.436918306Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-11-18-F22-Week-12":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-11-29 Tuesday]] 22:09:38\ndescription:: ⬜ \n\nnext: [[2022-11-25 F22 Week 13]]\n\n[[2022-11-14 Monday]]\n- [[2022-11-14 CSCI243]]\n- [[2022-11-14 MATH211]]\n- [[2022-11-14 CHIN309]]\n[[2022-11-15 Tuesday]]\n- [[2022-11-15 JAPN208]]\n- [[2022-11-15 CSCI232]]\n[[2022-11-16 Wednesday]]\n- [[2022-11-16 CSCI243]]\n- [[2022-11-16 MATH211]]\n- [[2022-11-16 CHIN309]]\n[[2022-11-17 Thursday]]\n- [[2022-11-17 JAPN208]]\n[[2022-11-18 Friday]]\n- [[2022-11-18 CSCI243]]\n- [[2022-11-18 MATH211]]\n\n```dataview\nTABLE description FROM \"Fleeting Notes\"\nWHERE file.day \u003e= date(2022-11-14) AND file.day \u003c= date(2022-11-18)\nSORT file.day ASC\n```","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.436918306Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-11-18-MATH211":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-11-21 Monday]] 11:05:01\ndescription:: no class, remote midterm 2 posted\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.436918306Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-11-21-CHIN309":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-11-29 Tuesday]] 16:54:50\ndescription:: no class, thanksgiving\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.436918306Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-11-21-CSCI243":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-11-21 Monday]] 11:04:40\ndescription:: inclusion-exclusion, (generalized) pigeonhole\n\ncontinuing combinatorics\n\ncontinuing password example\neach password will contain 5 letters and one digit\nneed to take into account that the digit could be anywhere in the string, and thats important (\"7ABCDE\" is different from \"A7BCDE\")\n\n\n##### Inclusion-exclusion principle\nIf a task can be done in $n_1$ or $n_2$ ways, but there are $m$ ways of the set of the $n_1$ ways which are also in the set of the $n_2$ ways, then the total number of ways to do the task is $n_1 + n_2 - m$.\n\nbasically just subtract the overlapping cases so they arent counted twice\n\nex. the number of 8-bit strings that start with 1 or end with 00\n$1**** * * {*} : 2^7$ such strings\n$******00 : 2^6$ such strings\n$1 ***** 00: 2^5$ such strings\nTotal: $2^7 + 2^6 - 2^5$ = 128 + 64 - 32 = 160\n\n\n##### Pigeonhole principle\nIf $k$ is a positive integer and $k+1$ or more objects are placed into $k$ boxes, then there is at least one box containing two or more objects.\n\naka 2 boxes and 3 blocks, one box will have more than one block always\n\nhe goes over proof for this but i dont wanna write\n\nex.

I am emailing to let you know about a shift in plans: I think the discussion that I wanted to have in class today would work much better in person. So instead of meeting remotely this afternoon, I am going to record the lecture on short-stories and post it for you to watch when you have a moment. We will hold the discussion on Monday after the break instead! We will be talking about the social role of literature in China vs. the West, and having a general discussion about the class materials up to this point.\n\nso discussion today\n\nfinal presentations\n- on monday wednesday next week! \u003e.? !\n- everyone should be ready on monday to be fair\n- will take volunteers\n- no extensions\n- expectations\n\t- 5 slides (title slide 3 content slides closing slide)\n\t- explain what project is and what stage youre at\n\nfinal reflection essay\n- 5 reflection essays\n- and a final reflection essay\n- switching that essay to be due same time as final project\n- does that means 5th or a 6th one\n- um oki\n\nso finishing up coursework\n- final reflection\n- final project\n- short reflective essay\n\t- 600-800 on takeaways from the class\nall 3 due at the same time when final project is due\n\nscrapping the requirement about the one essay must refelct differences of social role blah blah yeah i thought he would\nbut thats what we're talking about today\n\nways we interact with literature is distinct\nmost ppl today arent into poetry\nbut for the average educated person in premodern china, poetry was important\nalso how ppl engage with drama\ndifference between watching and reading a play\ndifferent kinds of performances\nperforming in public spaces in the background vs on a stage in a theatre\n\nwhat have we encountered in this class that you find interesting?\n- in the more literary work theres a high level of formality, specific style\n- consuming a piece of media in public, half paying attention half eating or doing something else\n\t- like watching a tv show while on your phone\n- accessibility\n\t- accessible in drama format - out in the open\n\t\t- today, less accessible\n\t- certain poetry prose was gatekept\n\t\t- circulated among smaller circles\n\t- depends on the kind of drama, some meant to be performed, some meant to be read\n\t- shakespeare, some found them highbrow, many sat in the peanut gallery, performed in vernacular tongue\n- scandalous\n\t- like in [[A Burial Mound for Flowers]] scene in the red chamber where they read [[Master Dong's Western Chamber Romance]] and its like they arent supposed to be reading\n\t- like fanfiction\n- anonymity\n\t- novels we talked about were so successful but still were published anonymously\n\t- didnt want to ruin their reputation, even though so popular\n\t- like fanfiction\n\t- pseudonyms used all throughout history\n- historical influence\n\t- many of the stories framed as recounting historical events and not just telling stories\n\t- early fiction establishes themes\n\t- like how in western literature we see reference to the bible or shakespeare, in chinese literature we see different works establishing themes and being referenced\n\t- \"relying on earlier literature as a mode of political critique in a framework that tries to minimize political critique\"\n\t\t- using older poems to highlight something else\n\t\t- allusion\n\t\t- ex. references to book of songs to critique foreign affairs one instance whre someone alluded to a poem where a minister did something wrong and the person it was written about realized they were saying that they did something wrong\n\t- so many footnotes in our readings trying to describe all these references!\n\t\t- \"how connected to history literature is\"\n\t\t- dictionaries of references circulated! needed in order to understand complex texts and understand what works were referencing\n\t\t- \"so much meaning was imbued in these references\"\n\t\t- today - how much of the internet is gonna make sense in 10 years without understanding all the references before?\n\t- because china is so old we see the morphology of literature\n\t\t- from historical record keeping to autobiographical allusions to historical stories to etc to fiction\n\t- before its time\n\t\t- written so so long ago, interesting how these ideas/words existed for so long, how they define history\n\t\t- the idea of references being so entangled into the media seems like a novel idea\n\t\t- star trek the next generation season 5 episode 2 a world where people only talk in references\n\t- old literature influences modern media, whether eastern or western\n\t\t- all the remakes of [[Journey to the West]]\n\t\t- like all the remakes of fairy tales and old movies\n\t\t- stories that stick around for so long\n\t\t- common tendency to remake things\n\t\t- Ponyo was created because studio ghibli thought disney did a bad job with the little mermaid, its like how so many rewrites of [[Story of Ying-ying]] were made\n\nwhats been the most surprising of the things weve encountered in class?\n- who was writing this literature\n\t- lifelong politicians\n\t\t- in western cultures you dont necessarily associate politicians with literature and beautiful poems\n\t\t- makes sense as they were the ones who were educated but still different\n\t\t- made poetry such a respected form of art, because it was written by respected members of society\n- surprised how casually some were written\n\t- links to some of the distinct ways poems are used in china\n\t- fundamental form of expression\n- sex \n\t- premarital specifically\n\t- devastating in some stories vs doesnt matter\n\t- dependent on the writer or how it was seen in society?\n\t- different attitudes presented\n\t- different attitudes based on gender\n- how little respect fiction/novels had in the beginning\n\t- written anonymously\n\t- not respected, lowbrow\n\t- shows emphasis put on education and language as a tool to transmit education\n\t- books reflect the environment in which they were created\n\t- luxury of being able to be a literati/writer\n- portrayal of minorities / diversity\n\t- changing over time\n\t- china culture isnt unchanging; \"many periods of very diverse culture with interest of all sorts of things\"\n\t- tend to think of it as a much more monolithic thing than it was\n\t- because of use of language, reinforcement of older styles\n\t- doesnt change that what people were writing in different dynasties different eras is very distinct from other periods\n\t- also dependent on whats been translated, what becomes part of the \"canon\" of chinese literature is usually the most popular stuff\n\nthis class is introduction to chinese literature\n- over the course of 2800 years\n- is there any other class that covers literature over such a wide span of time?\n- does it make sense to have a class like this?\n- we could spend so long on this topic, does it make sense to only spend a semester on it?\n- some infinities are bigger than others, theres practically infinite depth in any course\n- snapshot of it\n- what does an american literature course look like at a chinese university?\n- \n\n\n\noffice hours 9:30 tomorrow\ni could ask ab the final project adn try to brain storm\n\n- [ ] CHIN309 final project - frame as influence of chinese literature in the west - is it growing, stagnant, diminishing, today? in the future? in the past? western literature's influence in china?\n\n---\n\nok watching the asynch video from last week\n\nPresentations\n- 4 to 6 minutes, at least 5 slides\n- Describe your project plans\n\t- What is the topic?\n\t- Why is it interesting?\n\t- What type of project is it?\n- Share the project's current status\n\t- Roadblocks you've encountered\n\t- Issues you still need to take care of\n- Be ready to present December 5th\n- Fine to change topic after presenting, but won't have much chance for more feedback\n\n##### Jiang Xingge Reencounters his Pearl Shirt\n- focuses on a merchant\n- im bored i think i could just pklay minecraft and watch this while i do that\n- he talks ab stories

strong thesis id be more lenient with the rest\"\n\n##### [[Child of Okinawa]]\ninitial thoughts\n- good at emulating the voice of a young person\n- interesting how Tsune thinks logically about some points and illogically about others\n- even though author was an adult he wrote the novella very well in a childish manner\n- okinawa from a childs perspective\n- tsuneyoshi is like 12 years old either elem or middle school\n\npresenters\n- 1\n\t- \"pretty mundane story\" nothing extraordinary happens\n\t- just follows tsuneyoshis life\n\t- important themes throughout\n\t\t- conflict with parents\n\t\t- military occupation\n\t\t- adolescence\n\t\t- sexual themes\n\t- he feels like a burden to his family\n\t- abuse from parents\n\t- feels like a burden and resents family at the same time\n\t- very negative feelings toward occupation\n\t\t- soldier throwing a grenade into a bar\n\t\t- parents have to sell women\n\t\t- grandparents farm paved over\n\t- how occupation affects woman specifically\n\t\t- in [[The Only Woman in the Room]] story about empowering women\n\t\t- here, the opposite\n\t- highlights how occupation hurts those occupied\n- 2\n\t- growing anti us sentiment\n\t- use of tsuneyoshi as a child magnifies the effects of the occupation, doesnt understand why these things have to happen\n\t- taxi driver\n\t\t- displayed soldiers' blatant disregard for law and safety\n\t\t- \"theyve taken it too far this time\"\n\t\t- didnt even pay the cab driver their fare\n- 3\n\t- in particular the ways it expresses the impacts bases and soldiers had on every day life\n\t- home no longer fully feels like home / home is being taken away\n\t\t- seen in tsuneyoshis privacy not respected\n\t- reminisces about life before the war in the village tsune used to live in\n\t- correlates feelings of loss with increased presence of soldiers\n\t- yearns to escape and live on an island\n\t- strained relationships\n\t\t- between soldiers and okinawans\n\t\t- taxi driver and soldiers\n\t\t- tsune and family members\n\t- \"this town where everyone's life is filled with misery, this town where women are sold night and day\"\n\t- expresses a much darker and dismal image of how life has become\n\t- storm at the end signifies how hard it is to escape, symbolic of the occupation\n\t- the ship probably wouldve sunk and tsune died after the end\n\t- mineos view of okinawa is that its already sunken\n\nIssues to consider\n- narratives of american presnece\n- relations between the japanese and the americans; and among the japanese\n- images of okinawa that the novel creates\n- comparison to the previous readings\n\ndifference from other two readings\n- other two focused on mainland japan\n- okinawa was colonized by the us\n- different levels of occupation\n- japan rebuilt after the war and became a big economy, but okinawa was left to remain poor and ravaged\n- difference in perspective; this story is from the other side of the war\n- sirota gordon was more an observer, tsune is living in it, suffering\nsimilarities\n- tensions between japan and us\nwhat if a japanese person talked about the same thing sirota gordon talked about? would the narrative change?\n- would be very different, more bleak\n- other side of the war\nwhat if an american person talked about the same thing mineo talked about? would the narrative change?\n- probably more similar to gordon, just observing whats happening\n- watered down\nperspective is very important in framing the actual events\nnarrative depends on the narrator\n\ntsuneyoshi being a kid\n- tsunes perspective as a kid magnifies the effect of occupation\n- makes the story so much more horrifying seeing what the kid is exposed to\n- can empathize more with this character\n- because hes a child wandering around the city, we see more of okinawa than otherwise, different perspectives\n\nrelation between okinawans and americans, okinawans and okinawans\n- okinawans are being treated poorly, in financial crisis\n- businesses are there because they need to capitalize on money coming in from soldiers passing through the city\n- colonial relationship\n- okinawan economy depends on american forces\n- novel describes how okinawa was built around the military highway; this place shouldnt even exist\n- class separation\n- dont have a choice, need to run businesses catering to americans in order to put food on the table\n- sex industry in okinawa\n\t- happens in many other places with military bases\n\t- similar economic structures\n\t- divide between gender, how women are treated\n\t- women are the people bringing in money\n- in the novel, prostitutes are presented pretty much as normal workers\n\t- from tsunes perspective, part of every day mundane life\n- relation between american soldiers and japanese prostitutes\n\t- inequality in gender, and race, and class\n\nimages of okinawa\n- rundown, dirty\n\t- nature aspects have been ruined, overflowing with sewage, tsunes living conditions are dirty\n\t- tsune uses the beach, being out in nature as an escape from the city\n\t- nature contrasts with urban environments\n- \"today in japanese imagination, okinawa is mostly a tourist destination, uncontaminated\"\n\t- okinawa today is by far the poorest prefecture in japan\n\t- still viewed as a nice tourist destination\n- tainted\n\t- describes nice landscapes, and then an american outpost in the middle\n\t- beautiful wharf lined with american yachts\n\t- nature as a juxtaposition for innocence, areas that are still untouched\n\ncomparison to two previous readings\n- difference in audience\n- in beyond vietnam see how japan is separated, other asian nations are underdeveloped and japan is more well off; this reading shows that isnt so true\n- reischauer talks about improving countries that the us is trying to democratize, okinawa is outside of that scope\n- reischauer mainly talking about european colonialism, not american colonialism\n- sees colonialism as something thats already over\n\nhow would you describe the reading in a few words\n- perverted\n- tainted\n- explotation","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.436918306Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-11-30-CHIN309":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting  \ncreation date: [[2022-11-30 Wednesday]]

eep also im like 8 min late to class bc fire alarm went off\n\nalso we're in much more recent history now, 1700s, 1800s, 1900s\n\n##### The Peony Pavillion\n- set in tsung dynasty\n- very slow\n\t- like 55 scenes\n\t- very uncommon to see the entire thing performed at once\n\t- performance of the play in new york a few years ago was like 12 hours long thats pretty quick\n\t- a dvd of the full thing produced was like 30 hours long\n\t- intended for coneissuers, for elite consumption\n- plot about like\n\t- dreams and lovers and a emperor and death and uhh im not following and the exams and theyre destined to marry each other and the guy is arrested but he passes the exams and is released and marries the girl whatevr\n- Mei Lanfang\n\t- 1894-1961\n\t- played the main girl\n\t- men were traditionally actors, men famously played women\n\t- very famous actor\n- these plays tend to be so infused with meaning\n\t- actors and actresses are trained with a very detailed set of structured movements that are meant to contain deep feeling\n\t- hand gestures\n- scene 7\n\t- this was the reading i think\n\t- Scene 7: The Schoolroom\n\t- we meet a tutor\n\t\t- \"Kaun-kuan cry the ospreys / on the islet in the river\"\n\t- thats a poem we talked about from the Shijing, classis of poetry, that i dont have a link for for some reason\n\t- tutor is teaching whats their name about poetry and stuff\n\t- vulgarity and humor\n\t- how common was it for women to be educated, and pass the exams?\n\t\t- upper class thing, with the expectation theyd be able to educate themselves\n\n##### The Peach Blossom Fan (The Background)\n- a historical play, abotu historical events, that happened within the living memory of the author (or their parents); recent\n- story about infighting of higher individuals that may have led to the downfall of the Ming dynasty (turned into Qing dynasty)\n- takes place in nanjing during ming dynasty\n- similar style/form as the peony pavillion (i didnt catch what the type of play is called)\n- Kong Shangren 1648-1718\n\t- most known for this play\n\t- he was a descendant of confucius\n- The Fall of the Ming Dynasty\n\t- a eunuch guy that became good friends with the emperors wetnurse(?) and climbs up in rank and gains a lot of power\n\t- idea of eunuchs coming to more power than they should is linked to the fall of dynasties; almost a trope at this point!\n\t- where they draw the beginning of the fall of the ming\n- Hou Fangyu and Li Xiangjun\n\t- two main characters\n\t- hou fangyu a guy travelling thru wherver during whatever, part of a society aimed at rooting corruption out of the govt\n\t- falls in love with a girl named Li Xiangjun\n\t- in reality relationship happened way after play is set\n\t- Hou Fangyu takes the imperial exams and fails\n- Ruan Dacheng 1587-1646\n\t- famous dramatist\n\t- well known literati\n\t- takes a role in the southern ming opposition govt, against the current established govt\n\t- clown archetype of character aka the villain\n\t- presented as evil\n\t- tries to set up marriage between hou fangyu and li xiangjun to get on his good side or something but it backfires or something\n- beijing falls (what!)\n- restoration society hou fangyu is a part of falls\n- uh anyways very complicated dramatic play\n- Shi Kefa 1601-1645(?)\n\t- presented in the story as having the souther ming ports best interests\n\t- presented as a good guy\n\t- historically led one of the very last stands of the ming dynasty\n\t- historically one of the worst massacres thats ever happened when the city _ is raided i didnt hear which by Qing troops\n\t- in the Qing dynasty, the dynasty he fought against, revered as a paramount loyal official\n\t\t- you want your govt full of shi kefas and not the people who collaborated against the govt\n\n##### The Peach Blossom Fan (The Object)\n- theres a fan in the play!\n- conveys very significant meaning in the story, almost fetishized\n- early in the play, hou fangyu gives li xiangjun the fan\n- later she attempts to commit suicide for reasons (dacheng tries to punish hou fangyu by having li xianjun married to someone else), she hits her head on a pillar and bleeds on the fan\n- another character takes the blood and paints peach blossoms on it and sends to hou fengyu\n- hou fengyu says the fan is more valuable than his own life\n\n##### The Peach Blossom Fan (The Text)\n- prologue starts with an old man, set in 1684, like 20 years after events of the play(?) after fall of the ming dynasty\n\t- old man used to be a master of ceremonies, talks about how good life is rn\n\t- \"The sun beams brightly on a world well governed.\"\n\t- story that valorizes people that fought hard against the Qing dynasty\n\t- is this an affective way to open a play?\n\t\t- covering your bases\n\t\t- people reading the play were elites, educated\n\t\t- dangerous to talk about ppl who fought against the dynasty\n\t\t- author wrote this bit to keep it safe\n\t\t- had more protection bc he was a descendant of confucius\n\t\t- \"this play couldve never been written in the 1660s\" not until like 1670s the qing got rid of most of their opposition\n\t- setting the scene, describing nature\n\t\t- when these plays were performed, didnt have sets\n- play start\n- ch'en and wu gossiping about latest news on the bandits\n- ming dynasty doesnt have the troops to fight these forces\n- \"The fate of the dynasty is sealed. We might as well enjoy the spring while it lasts,\"\n- how is this different from how history has been talked about in previous readings?\n\t- pretty direct, in other readings it was about using older stories to allude to whats happening\n\t- \"here it feels like two dudes in a bar talking about the war in ukraine\"\n\t\t- happening nearby, but still far away\n\t\t- more distant\n\t- interaction with real events is a constant thread throughout the play, talking about the news\n\t- a sense of not knowing for sure whats really happening\n\n##### Takeaways\nwhich of these plays do you like better?\n- dont like the fatalism in the peach blossom fan\n- liked second one more for pretentious reasons, pretentious historical fiction\nis there anything different we've seen from these two plays?\n- historical fiction plays take off around the late ming dynasty\n- most plays not super historical\n- in ming dynasty, more and more fascination with retelling historical events\n- interesting about peach blossom fan is that it retells recent history at the time, within living memory, like 30-40 years after\n- these arent plays being performed in the marketplace, more highbrow","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.436918306Z","tags":null},"/Fleeting-Notes/2022-11-30-CSCI243":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #fleeting\ncreation date: [[2022-11-30 Wednesday]] 11:07:58\ndescription::\n\nclass asynch friday video posted today\n\nuhhh i wasnt paying attention what are we doing\n\npigeonhole\n\nex. for any positive integer n, there is a multiple of n that contains only 0s and 1s.\n\nproof: for positive integer n consider the following n + 1 integers\n1, 11, 111, ... , 1...1\nwhere the last number contains n + 1 1s. note that there are n remainders, 0, ... , n-1,, when an integer is divided by n (ie mod n $\\in$ {0, ..., n-1})\nby the pigeonhole principle, among the n+1 numbers in our list there must be two numbers a and b with a \u003e b with the same remainder when divided by n\nso a - b is divisible by n, thus a multiple of n and a-b contains only 0s and 1s.\n\nthis makes not a lot of sense at all what a weird ass proof\n\n\nanother pigeonhole ex.\n\nIn a month of 30 days, a baseball team plays at least one game a day but no more than 45 games in the month.

This is a **valid** argument.\n\nTypically, an argument is a sequence of [[Proposition|Propositions]].\n\n**Argument form** is the notation that replaces the argument with a sequence of compound propositions and/or [[Predicate|Predicates]]. The argument can also be presented in argument form using propositional variables to represent the propositions.\nArgument form is the simplified version of the argument\n\n##### Argument Form Notation\n![[Pasted image 20220919213114.png]]\nusing propositional variables, argument form may look like this:\n![[Pasted image 20220919213406.png]]\nrepresenting a generalized form of the argument\n\n##### Proving an Argument is Valid\nExample:\n\"If you have a correct password, you can log onto the network.\"\n\"You have a current password.\"\nTherefore,\n\"You can log onto the network.\"\n\nWritten in proper notation, with $p$ = you have a correct password and $q$ = you can log onto the network:\n![[Pasted image 20220919213406.png]]\n\nHow do we prove this example is true/this argument is valid?\n...\nThere are logical ways to prove that the argument is valid, but let's just skip to the laws we can use to streamline these justifications. We could always use truth tables to show that an argument form is valid, or we could use laws consisting of simple argument forms and combine them to validate argument forms.\n\nThese laws/rules are called [[Rules of Inference]].\n\n\n\n## References\nTextbook 1.6\npg 70, definition 1 is a good definition of argument and argument form\n\n[[2022-09-12 CSCI243]] quantifiers continued, arguments, rules of inference, tautology","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.436918306Z","tags":null},"/Topic-Notes/Basic-Variable":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #topic\ncreation date: [[2022-09-05 Monday]] 23:15:22\nmodification date: [[2022-09-05 Monday]] 23:15:22\n\n## Basic Variable\n[[Linear System|Linear Systems]] may contain basic variables.

The novel is heavily inspired by Higashi's childhood in Okinawa. The story gives insight into the sheer degree of America's rule over the island. Okinawa City itself, where young Tsuneyoshi and his family run a bar, was built along the military highway by Japanese displaced by the war in order to attract business from soldiers passing through. There are many parallels to John Okada's No No Boy in the story, such as the main character's strained relationship with his parents due to the effects of the war and the somber tone of the story. Unlike No No Boy, there is little mention of Japanese identity. Instead of looking at the internal conflict brought about by the war and occupation, the characters around Tsuneyoshi seem resigned to this life, and make little mention of the occupation. The adults around Tsuneyoshi gossip about crimes committed by soldiers with the same tone they might talk about damage after a typhoon; like the occupation is a natural disaster, and there's nothing they can do to prevent it.\n\nIt's made clear that Okinawa is no place for a child to grow up. Tsuneyoshi is surrounded by sex work and the novel spares no detail in describing how his parents' business affects him. Where other post-war novels might show the brutal aftermath of war by describing characters with a desensitization to violence, Higashi paints a grotesque picture of Okinawa by describing Tsuneyoshi's desensitization to sex, leaving the reader feeling uncomfortable. The end of the reading shows Tsuneyoshi enacting his plan to escape his parents and \"this town where everyone's life is filled with misery, this town where women are sold night and day\" (114), by boarding an American yacht during a typhoon, and ends there abruptly. Whether Tsuneyoshi escapes Okinawa is left ambiguous, which I find symbolic of the lasting effects of American occupation even today in Okinawa.","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.436918306Z","tags":null},"/Topic-Notes/Code-References/Code-Snippets-from-CSCI100":{"title":"","content":"Tags: #flashcards #CSCI100\nCreated: Wednesday,

All nonzero rows are above any rows of all zeroes. (Zero rows at the bottom)\n2. Each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry of the row above it. (Negative diagonal, or \"steplike\" pattern)\n3.

Scalar/Scaling\n\tMultiply all entries in a row by a nonzero constant.\n\t$\\alpha * R_i, \\alpha \\neq 0$\n\nThese row operations preserve the solution set for the matrix. Two matrices are called **row equivalent** if a sequence of elementary row operations can transform one into the other.

It was not the boy but the mother who is also the son and it is she who is to blame and it is she who is dead because the son did not know.”\n\t  “I just know that Bob is dead.” \n\t  “No, the mother. It is she who is dead because she did not conduct herself as a Japanese and, no longer being Japanese, she is dead.” \n\t- “And the father? What about Mr. Kumasaka?” \n\t  “Yes, dead also.” \n\t  “And you, Ma? What about you and Pa?” \n\t  “We are Japanese as always.” \n\t  “And me?” \n\t  “You are my son who is also Japanese.”\n\t- “That makes everything all right, does it? That makes it all right that Bob is dead, that war was fought and hundreds of thousands killed and maimed, and that I was two years in prison and am still Japanese?”\n\t  “Yes.”\n\t  “What happens when I'm no longer Japanese?”\n\t  “How so?”\n\t  “Like Bob, I mean. What happens if I sign up and get shot up like him?”\n\t  “Then I will be dead too.”\n\t  “Dead like me?”\n\t  “Yes, I will be dead when you go into the army of the Americans. I will be dead when you decide to go into the army of the Americans. I will be dead when you begin to cease to be Japanese and entertain those ideas which will lead you to your decision which will make you go into the army of the Americans. I will be dead long before the bullet strikes you. But you will not go, for you are my son.”\n\nthis is like the role of the korean mothers in teaching their children japanese when they were being assimilated\n\n- Kenji vs Ichiro\n\t- So they sat silently through the next drink, one already dead but still alive and contemplating fifty or sixty years more of dead aliveness, and the other, living and dying slowly. They were two extremes, the Japanese who was more American than most Americans because he had crept to the brink of death for America, and the other who was neither Japanese nor American because he had failed to recognize the gift of his birthright when recognition meant everything.\n\t- But a leg that was eating itself away until it would consume the man himself in a matter of a few years was something else, for hobbling toward death on a cane and one good leg seemed far more disastrous than having both legs and an emptiness that might conceivably still be filled.\n\n- Sleeping\n\t- THERE IS A PERIOD BETWEEN EACH NIGHT AND DAY WHEN one dies for a few hours, neither dreaming nor thinking nor tossing nor hating nor loving, but dying for a little while because life progresses in just such a way. From that sublime depth, a stranger awakens to strain his eyes into focus on the walls of a strange room. Where am I? he asks himself. There is a fleeting sound of lonely panic as he juggles into order the heavy, sleep-laden pieces of his mind's puzzle. He is frightened because the bed is not his own.\n- Kenji\n\t- Then maybe there is no someplace else. Maybe dying is it. The finish. The end. Nothing. I'd like that too. Better an absolute nothing than half a meaning. The living have it tough. It's like a coat rack without pegs, only you think there are. Hang it up, drop, pick it up, hang it again, drop again…\n\t- “He was a good boy, pleasant, thoughtful, well-liked, but never really happy. The others, they seem not to mind so much. They say to themselves this is the way things are, and they are quite happy. He was not that way. He was always asking why things had to be the way they were. For him, I often think I should have never come to America. For him, I think I should have stayed in Japan, where he would have been a Japanese with only other Japanese, and then, maybe, he would not now be dead. It is too late now for such thoughts.”\n- Ma\n\t- Dead, he thought to himself, all dead. For me, you have been dead a long time, as long as I can remember. You, who gave life to me and to Taro and tried to make us conform to a mold which never existed for us because we never knew of it, were never alive to us in the way that other sons and daughters know and feel and see their parents. But you made so many mistakes. It was a mistake to have ever left Japan. It was a mistake to leave Japan and to come to America and to have two sons and it was a mistake to think that you could keep us completely Japanese in a country such as America.\n\t- With me, you almost succeeded, or so it seemed. Sometimes I think it would have been better had you fully succeeded. You would have been happy and so might I have known a sense of completeness. But the mistakes you made were numerous enough and big enough so that they, in turn, made inevitable my mistake. I have had much time to feel sorry for myself. Suddenly I feel sorry for you. Not sorry that you are dead, but sorry for the happiness you have not known. So, now you are free. Go back quickly. Go to the Japan that you so long remembered and loved, and be happy. It is only right.\n\t- If it is only after you've gone that I am able to feel these things, it is because that is the way things are. Too late I see your unhappiness, which enables me to understand a little and, perhaps, even to love you a little, but it could not be otherwise. Had you lived another ten years or even twenty, it would still have been too late. If anything, my hatred for you would have grown. You are dead and I feel a little peace and I want very much for you to know the happiness that you tried so hard to give me…\n\n\t- Time, how slowly it passes. I will hope and wait and hope and wait and there will come a time. It must be so. She is dead. Time has swept her away and time will bury my mistake. She is dead and I am not sorry. I feel a little bit freer, a bit more hopeful.\n\n- Emi\n\t- “It's because we're American and because we're Japanese and sometimes the two don't mix. It's all right to be German and American or Italian and American or Russian and American but, as things turned out, it wasn't all right to be Japanese and American. You had to be one or the other.”\n\n- idk where\n\t- “The young Japanese hates the not-so-young Japanese who is more Japanese than himself, and the not-so-young, in turn, hates the old Japanese who is all Japanese and, therefore, even more Japanese than he...”\n\n\nI can frame this with each character\n- Bobbie\n- Kenji\n- Ma\n- Gary\nmaybe pa at the end as the one who survives\nalso freddie he dies right at the end idk what to make of that\n\nBobbie \n- introduces the idea\n- died in the war\n- Ichiros' mom says that his mother is the one who is dead, because her son went off to war\n- By joining the US army, Bobbie lost his identity as Japanese\n- and his mom died because she let this happen\n- \"no longer being Japanese, she is dead.\"\n- and the father too\n- the whole family has lost their identity because they failed the son\n- \"I will be dead when you begin to cease to be Japanese and entertain those ideas which will lead you to your decision which will make you go into the army of the Americans.

In *No No Boy*, John Okada describes another death: the loss of identity. After serving two years in prison for refusing to enlist in World War II, Ichiro Yamada finds himself back home not knowing who he is anymore. The novel follows Ichiro as he wrestles with what it means to be Japanese-American and if there is any hope for his future. He visits old friends and family and finds the novel explores their postwar struggles as well. A consistent theme of the novel is death, both literal and figurative, with characters described as half-dead, close to dead, already dead, or even reborn. Multiple characters die during the few weeks that the book spans. Through this, Okada tries to portray how he feels about the identity of Japanese-Americans as a whole.\n\n##### Thesis statement i guess second paragraph\nOkada's consistent use of death throughout No No Boy represents the loss of identity, particularly Japanese identity, that the characters struggle with throughout the novel. Each person Ichiro bonds with represents a different identity crisis and a different perspective of death. Through these perspectives amd through these deaths, Okada builds up the loss of inherited identity as a kind of death, and this death, both the fight against it amd desire for it, create the main conflict of the novel.\n\n##### Death 1. Bobbie Kumasaka\nAfter reacquainting with his family, Ichiro and his mother visit the Kumasakas, another Japanese family, to celebrate Ichiro coming home. Ichiro is surprised to find out that their son Bobbie enlisted in the army and died on the battlefield. Later, Ichiro's mother says that she didn't tell him about his death because it was unimportant. \"It was not the boy but the mother who is also the son and it is she who is to blame and it is she who is dead because the son did not know” (Chapter 2). Because Bobbie's mother couldn't stop him from joining the American forces, it was her fault that he had died, and further, she was dead because she had failed in keeping him loyal to Japan. With Bobbie, we see the idea of being dead while alive, because of a failure to stay attached to Japan and detached from America.\n\n##### Death 2. Kenji\nIchiro's mother has similar feelings about Kenji, Ichiro's friend who enlisted in the army. The war took Kenji's leg, an injury which eventually led to his death. Kenji and Ichiro are described as \"two extremes, the Japanese who was more American than most Americans $[...]$, and the other who was neither Japanese nor American\" (Chapter 4), further emphasizing Ichiro's lack of identity. Kenji is almost the complete opposite of Ichiro, and Ichiro wishes he could trade places with him. He wanted to trade away his frustration with what he did for an infected leg that could soon kill him. This shows how Ichiro feels he is already dead, because he has lost his identity, and has no hope in figuring out who he could be. Of course, the trade isn't possible, but the kindness Kenji shows Ichiro throughout the book is a key contributor to the hope he feels at the end of the story. With Kenji, we see the opposite of Ichiro, but both still dead in different ways.\n\n##### Death 3. Mrs. Yamada\nDuring the Kominka movement in Japan, when the empire attempted to expand and assimilate Korea and Taiwan, Korean mothers played an important role in assimilation. Korean language was prohibited and Korean mothers raised their children to speak in Japanese dialects, not Korean ones. Ichiro's mother fought against this very thing happening with her children in America. She stayed loyal to Japan and refused to learn English or become any closer to the country. The war only heightened her patriotism, which evolved into hysteria, believing that Japan were the real victors.\n\nAfter her death, it feels as though a weight has been lifted off of Ichiro and his father. With her death, they could finally learn to embrace America. Where the Korean mothers in Japan were forced into making their children Japanese, Mrs. Yamada fought to keep her children from becoming American. Ichiro was being pulled on one side by the woman who raised him and on the other side by the country he was raised in; \"because one is not born in America and raised in America and taught in America and one does not speak and swear and drink and smoke and play and fight and see and hear in America among Americans in American streets and houses without becoming American and loving it\" (Chapter 1). It wasn't until her death that this tension ended, letting Ichiro see the world with new eyes and the ability to find his own identity. With Mrs. Yamada, we see death enabling Ichiro to let go of his past identity. Her death was Ichiro's death, the death Ichiro had been chasing; letting go of the Japanese part of his identity, his mother's identity, to build a new one.\n\n##### Death 4. Gary\nAfter his mother's death, Ichiro begins looking for work and is led to an old friend, another no-no boy named Gary. He finds purpose in life through painting, and feels reborn; \"I died in prison. And when I came back to life, all that really mattered for me was to make a painting\" (Chapter 10). Where imprisonment broke Ichiro, Gary found new meaning in life; new identity. Though their experiences are different, Gary may serve as a glimpse into Ichiro's near future, since Gary was released from prison earlier. While talking to Gary, Ichiro remembers the kindness shown to him by the man who offered him a job working with Gary, the man in Portland who offered a good wage, and he thinks about Kenji and Emi. At this point, Ichiro begins to realize the world isn't so bleak, and there may be hope for him after all. With Gary, we see that it's possible to go through what Ichiro went through and still find identity and passion in the end.\n\n##### Conclusion\nThroughout the book, Ichiro is shaped by the deaths of those around him, eventually being able to find a glimmer of hope by the end of the book. He begins to understand what it means for him to embrace America and rebuild his identity that was destroyed by his mother and the war. Through the framework of death, we see how Japanese-American identity was brought into the spotlight during the war and just like how many lost their lives, many lost their identity as well. However, rebirth is possible, and this chance to live life anew fuels Ichiro to keep living.\n\n\"Because we're American and because we're Japanese and sometimes the two don't mix.

The coefficient matrix pictured above is called a 3x3 matrix, and the augmented matrix is a 3x4 matrix.\n\n##### Usage\nOur goal is to simplify the matrix to have 1 nonzero number in each column representing each variable; this will give us our solution set.\nThe idea is to transform the matrix into an equivalent system (one with the same solution set) that is easy to solve.\nThe simplest procedure (for now?) is to transform the matrix into a **triangular matrix**, then isolate the variables from there.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220901213831.png]]\n\nA triangular matrix has leading zeroes following each row as seen above, making the coefficient part of the matrix (not including last column) triangular, not counting the zeroes. This terminology will be \"replaced by a precise term in the next section\" (pg 6).\n\nIn order to transform the given matrix into a triangular one, there are **3 elementary row operations** that can be used.\n\n[[Elementary Row Operations]]\n1. Replacement\n\tReplace one row by the sum of itself and a multiple of another row, or, add to one row a multiple of another row.\n\t$R_i = R_i + \\alpha * R_j, \\alpha \\neq 0$\n2. Interchange\n\tInterchange two rows.\n\t$R_i \\leftrightarrow R_j$\n3. Scalar/Scaling\n\tMultiply all entries in a row by a nonzero constant.\n\t$\\alpha * R_i, \\alpha \\neq 0$\n\nThese row operations preserve the solution set for the matrix. Two matrices are called **row equivalent** if a sequence of elementary row operations can transform one into the other. These operations are also reversible.\n\nOnce the matrix is in triangular form, elementary row operations can continue to be used in order to simplify the matrix and find the solutions.\n\n![[63913CFB-2B6D-47CB-BC2F-D98C078C39B9.jpeg]]\n\n**The goal is a matrix like the one above, with a 1 in each variable column.** The constants column now shows the answers. In this case, $x_1 = 1, x_2 = 0, x_3 = -1$, and the solution set is $(1, 0, -1)$. This answer can be confirmed by plugging the solution into the left side of the original system and confirming that the left and right side are equal.\n\n\n##### Equality\nIf the augmented matrices of two [[Linear System|linear systems]] are row equivalent, then the two systems have the same solution set.\n\n\n##### Using row operations on an augmented matrix to determine the nature of the solution set for a linear system\naka, is the system consistent or inconsistent?, aka, does the system have one existing solution, multiple solutions or no solutions?\n\nIn the case of the triangular matrix seen in the second image on this page, we already know $x_3$. We could substitute $x_3 = -1$ into equation 2 and find $x_2$ , and the same with equation 1. So, a solution exists, and the system is consistent. (We can go farther and say since $x_3$ has only one possible value, so does $x_2$ and $x_1$, making the solution unique).\n\n![[729502CA-8E64-4BE4-8993-A46FEE3845F3.jpeg]]\n\nIn the case of a triangular matrix like the one above, we find that 0 = 15. This means that there are no values of $x_1, x_2, x_3$ that satisfy this linear system, and the original linear system that comes from these row operations is inconsistent.\n\n\n## References\n[[2022-08-31 MATH211]]\nTextbook 1.1 page 4-8\nClass notes August 31 (https://blackboard.wm.edu/webapps/blackboard/execute/content/file?cmd=view\u0026content_id=_1966303_1\u0026course_id=_24295_1)","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.440918278Z","tags":null},"/Topic-Notes/Misc.-Notes/Fall-2022-Class-Registration":{"title":"","content":"# Fall 2022 Class Registration\n\nneed\n- cs 243\n- math 211\n\nalso need\n- some COLL200s at least one ALV or NQR\n- ALV\n\t- chinese science fiction (clashes with life before python)\n\t- chinese literature in english (clashes with life before python)\n\t- intro history of christianity (makes MW super long + boring)\n\t- crossing borders japan and travel (idk + TR)\n- NQR\n\t- math powered flight\n\nwant\n- competitive programming again\n- life beyond python (not gonna get only 3 seats open???)\n- linguistics?

The documentary gave me a feeling similar to the feeling I get from American Southern Gothic literature; an underlying sense of division and grief among this group of people. In Southern Gothic works this feeling comes from seeing people recuperating their lives after the Civil War, still suffering from the effects it had on them and trying to suppress these issues. The feeling is similar here because the conflict the school faces is only mentioned briefly a few times during the second half of the documentary, where it can't be avoided anymore. We see multiple types of division, including the division that comes from Japan's efforts to naturalize first generation Koreans, like the parents of the students in the documentary, and then from Japanese activists protesting against the North Korean school. We even see the division between North and South Korea, and hear how the students wish that one day the country would be united so that they can live in peace.","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.440918278Z","tags":null},"/Topic-Notes/Parametric-Description":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #topic\ncreation date: [[2022-09-05 Monday]] 23:34:13\nmodification date: [[2022-09-05 Monday]] 23:34:13\n\n## Parametric Description\n\nParametric Description is a format used to display the solution set of a [[Linear System]].\n\n![[Pasted image 20220905231359.png]]\nThis is an example of a *parametric description of a solution set*.\n\nEach variable in the linear system is defined with an equation composed of constants and [[Free Variable|Free Variables]].

But they have a number of important differences:\n\nArguments are defined as “a reason or set of reasons given with the aim of persuading others that an action or idea is right or wrong;” while proofs are defined as “evidence or argument establishing or helping to establish a fact or the truth of a statement.” [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-an-argument-and-proof)\n\nThe following are different methods of proof\n\n##### Direct Proof\nTo prove \"if $p$ then $q$,\" assume that $p$ is true and show that $q$ is true.\n\n##### Proof by Contraposition\nTo prove \"if $p$ then $q$,\" assume $q$ is false and show that $p$ is false.\n\nThis method is based on the tautology $p \\rightarrow q \\equiv \\neg q \\rightarrow \\neg p$.\n\n##### Proof by Contradiction\nTo prove $p$, assume $p$ is false and show there is $r$ such that $r$ is true and $\\neg r$ is true, a contradiction\n\nOr according to the textbook\nAssume both $p$ and $\\neg q$ are true and show a contradiction\nIdk man \n\nOr the internet\nAssume p is false\n\nOr\nAssume q is false\n\n- [ ] i gotta figure this out\n\n##### Proof by Cases\nWhen we are unable to prove a theorem with a single argument that holds for all possible cases, we may need to construct our proof for each of the possible cases, one by one.\n\nThis method relies on the rule of inference:\n$(p_1 \\vee p_2 \\vee ... \\vee p_n) \\rightarrow q$\n$\\equiv (p_1 \\rightarrow q) \\wedge (p_2 \\rightarrow q) \\wedge ... \\wedge (p_n \\rightarrow q)$\n\n##### Existence Proof\nTo prove there exists an object of a certain type, we can simply construct one.

The leading entry in each nonzero row is 1.\n2. Each leading 1 is the only nonzero entry in its column.\n\nAlso called Reduced Row Echelon Form\n\nA matrix in this form is called a Reduced Echelon Matrix\n\n![[Pasted image 20220905223152.png]]\n\nA method to row reduce a matrix into a Reduced Echelon Matrix is the [[Row Reduction Algorithm]]. Reducing a matrix to Reduced Echelon Form is done in order to find the solution set of its corresponding [[Linear System]].\n\nAll nonzero matrices can be row reduced into more than one matrix in echelon form using [[Elementary Row Operations]]. However, the reduced echelon form one obtains from a matrix is [[Uniqueness#Theorem Uniqueness of the Reduced Echelon Form|Unique]].\n\n\n## References\nTextbook 1.2\n[[2022-09-02 MATH211]]","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.440918278Z","tags":null},"/Topic-Notes/Row-Reduction-Algorithm":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #topic\ncreation date: [[2022-09-05 Monday]] 22:38:08\nmodification date: [[2022-09-05 Monday]] 22:38:08\n\n## Row Reduction Algorithm\n\nThe Row Reduction Algorithm consists of four steps used to produce a [[Matrix]] in [[Echelon Form]]. A fifth step produces a matrix in [[Reduced Echelon Form]].\n\n1. Begin with the leftmost nonzero column. This is a [[Pivot Position|pivot column]]. The [[Pivot Position|pivot position]] is at the top.\n2. Select a nonzero entry in the pivot column as a pivot. [[Elementary Row Operations|Interchange]] rows if necessary to move this entry into the pivot position.\n3. Use [[Elementary Row Operations|replacement operations]] to create zeroes in all positions below the pivot.\n4. Ignore the row containing the pivot position and all rows, if any, above it. Apply steps 1-3 to the submatrix that remains. Repeat the process until there are no more nonzero rows to modify.\n\nThese steps, called the **forward phase**, give us a matrix in echelon form.\n\n5. Beginning with the rightmost pivot and working upward and to the left, create zeroes above each pivot. If a pivot is not 1, make it 1 by a scaling operation.\n\nThis final step, called the **backward phase**, leaves us with a matrix in reduced echelon form.\n\nThe purpose of the algorithm is to assist in finding the solution set of a [[Linear System]].\nThe row reduction algorithm leads directly to an explicit description of the solution of a linear system when the algorithm is applied to the augmented matrix of the system.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220905231218.png]]\nIf this is the a linear system that has been changed into the equivalent reduced echelon form,\n\n![[Pasted image 20220905231257.png]]\nThis is the associated system of equations.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220905231359.png]]\nThis is what the solution set of the linear system looks like. We can see here that $x_3$ is a [[Free Variable]] and that $x_1, x_2$ are [[Basic Variable|Basic Variables]]. Each choice of $x_3$ determines a (different) solution of the system, and every solution of the system is determined by a choice of $x_3$.\nThis format for a solution set is called [[Parametric Description]].\n\n## References\nTextbook 1.2\n[[2022-09-02 MATH211]]","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.440918278Z","tags":null},"/Topic-Notes/Rules-of-Inference":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #topic\ncreation date: [[2022-09-19 Monday]] 21:51:08\nmodification date: [[2022-09-19 Monday]] 21:51:08\n\n## Rules of Inference\nUsed to simplify/validate [[Argument|Arguments]].\nThese are relatively simple valid argument forms that can be used as building blocks to construct more complicated valid argument forms.\n\n##### Modus Ponens\nThe [[Tautology]] $(p \\wedge (p \\rightarrow q)) \\rightarrow q$ is the basis for modus ponens, aka the law of detachment.\nLatin for \"mode that affirms.\"\n\n$p$\n$p \\rightarrow q$\n$\\_\\_\\_\\_$\n$q$\n\n##### Modus Tollens\nThe tautology $(\\neg q \\wedge (p \\rightarrow q)) \\rightarrow \\neg p$ is the basis for modus tollens.\n\"Inverse\" of modus ponens\n\n$\\neg q$\n$p \\rightarrow q$\n$\\_\\_\\_\\_$\n$\\neg p$\n\n##### Hypothetical Syllogism\nexample: \n\"all ferraris are red\"\n\"all red cars get tickets\"\nso\n\"all ferraris get tickets\"\n\n$p \\rightarrow q$\n$q \\rightarrow r$\n$\\_\\_\\_\\_$\n$p \\rightarrow r$\n\n##### Disjunctive Syllogism\nIf $p \\vee q$ is true, and $p$ is false, then $q$ must be true\n\n$p \\vee q$\n$\\neg p$\n$\\_\\_\\_\\_$\n$q$\n\n##### Addition\nIf $p$ for sure, then $p \\vee$ anything\n\n$p$\n$\\_\\_\\_\\_$\n$p \\vee q$\n\n##### Simplification\nIf $p \\wedge q$ is true, then p must be true\n\n$p \\wedge q$\n$\\_\\_\\_\\_$\n$p$\n\n##### Conjunction\nif $p$ and $q$ are both true separately, can be combined into compound proposition $p \\wedge q$\n\n$p$\n$q$\n$\\_\\_\\_\\_$\n$p \\wedge q$\n\n##### Resolution\nIn one statement, $p$ or $q$ evaluates to true\nIn another statement, $\\neg p$ or $r$ evaluates to true\nBecause these statements are both true, either $q$ or $r$ have to be true. \nIf $q$ and $r$ were both false, then both statements could not evaluate to true, as $p$ and $\\neg p$ cannot both be true at the same.\nWe can drop $p$ from consideration altogether and combine the statements into $q \\vee r$.\n\n$p \\vee q$\n$\\neg p \\vee r$\n$\\_\\_\\_\\_$\n$q \\vee r$\n\n\n## Rules of Inference for Quantified Statements\n##### Universal Instantiation\n$\\forall x P(x)$\n$\\_\\_\\_\\_$\n$P(c)$ for any specific number c\n\n##### Universal Generalization\n$P(c)$ for an arbitrary number c\n$\\_\\_\\_\\_$\n$\\forall x P(x)$\n\n##### Existential Instantiation\n$\\exists x P(x)$\n$\\_\\_\\_\\_$\n$P(c)$ for some number c\n\n##### Existential Generalization\n$P(c)$ for some number c\n$\\_\\_\\_\\_$\n$\\exists x P(x)$\n\n##### Universal Modus Ponens\n$\\forall x (P(x) \\rightarrow Q(x))$\n$P(a)$, where a is a particular element in the domain\n$\\_\\_\\_\\_$\n$Q(a)$\n\n##### Universal Modus Tollens\n$\\forall x (P(x) \\rightarrow Q(x))$\n$\\neg Q(a)$, where a is a particular element in the domain\n$\\_\\_\\_\\_$\n$\\neg P(a)$\n\n\n\n## References\nTextbook 1.6\n[[2022-09-12 CSCI243]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.440918278Z","tags":null},"/Topic-Notes/Sequence":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #topic\ncreation date: [[2022-10-11 Tuesday]] 20:34:33\nmodification date: [[2022-10-11 Tuesday]] 20:34:33\n\n## Sequence\nA sequence is a discrete structure used to represent an **ordered** list.

Set $A$ and its elements in $U$, the universal set\n2. Set $A$ as a subset of $B$\n3. Set $A$ and $B$, not overlapping, not subsets\n4. Set $A$ and $B$, overlapping but not subsets\nLatex commands: `\\subset`, `\\subseteq`\n\n\n##### Cardinality\nSets may be finite or infinite, depending on whether the number of elements it contains is finite or infinite.\nThe cardinality of a finite set $S$  is the number of elements in the set, and is denoted by $|S|$.\nFor example, $S = \\{a, b\\}$, $|S| = 2$.\n\n\n##### Power Set\nFor a given set $S$, the power set of $S$ is the set of all subsets of $S$. This is denoted as $P(S)$ and will be equal to $2^{|S|}$.\nWith every new element, the number of possible subsets doubles.\n![[Pasted image 20220928205239.png]]\nThis graphic uses a tree to visualize the number of subsets and how they are created. Note that **$\\emptyset$ is a subset of every set**.\n\n\n##### Cartesian Product\nThe Cartesian product of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set of all **ordered** pairs from $A$ and $B$, denoted as $A \\times B$.\nFor example, $A = \\{a, b\\}, B = \\{1, 2,3\\}$\n$A \\times B$\n$= \\{(a,b)|a \\in A \\wedge b \\in B\\}$\n$= \\{ (a, 1),  (a, 2),  (a, 3),  (b, 1),  (b, 2),  (b, 3) \\}$\nNote that $B \\times A \\neq A \\times B$.\n$B \\times A$\n$= \\{ (1, a),  (1, b),  (2, a),  (2, b),  (3, a),  (3, b) \\}$\nSets are unordered, however, the Cartesian product is the set of all **ordered** pairs of elements. Finite ordered lists of elements such as these pairs are called **tuples**.\nNote that $|A \\times B| = |A||B|$.\nA subset of $A \\times B$ is called a **relation** from $A$ to $B$. Functions are special relations.\nLatex command: `\\times`\n\n\n##### Quantifiers and Truth Sets\nQuantifiers can be used with sets. It can be useful to restrict a quantifier to a particular set. For example, $\\forall x \\in S(P(x))$, or $\\forall x \\in S \\exists y \\in F(P(x,y))$.\nThe truth set of a predicate $P(x)$ is defined as $\\{x \\in D |P(x)\\}$.\n\n\n## Set Operations\n##### Union\n$A \\cup B = \\{x|x \\in A \\vee x \\in B\\}$, $\\bigcup^n_{i=1} A_i = A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup ... \\cup A_n$\n\"Or\"\n![[Pasted image 20220928111203.png]]\n\n##### Intersection\n$A \\cap B = \\{x|x \\in A \\wedge x \\in B\\}$, $\\bigcap^n_{i=1} A_i = A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap ... \\cap A_n$\n\"And\"\n![[Pasted image 20220928111550.png]]\n\n##### Difference\n$A - B = \\{x|x \\in A \\wedge x \\notin B\\}$\nand, $|A - B| = |A| - |A \\cap B|$\n\"Subtraction\"\n![[Pasted image 20220928112156.png]]\n\n##### Complement\nWith respect to a universal set $U$: \n$\\bar A = U - A = \\{x|x \\notin A\\}$\nnote, represented by $\\bar A$\nLatex command: `\\bar A`\n\"Inverse\"\n![[Pasted image 20220928112527.png]]\n\n\n## Set Identities\nSet identities are used to simplift or manipulate an expression that involves sets.\n##### Identity Law\n$A \\cup \\emptyset = A, A \\cap U = A$\n\n##### Domination Law\n$A \\cup U = U, A \\cap \\emptyset = \\emptyset$\n\n##### Idempotent Law\n$A \\cup A = A, A \\cap A = A$\n\n##### Complementation Law\n$\\bar {\\bar {A}} = A$\n\n##### Absorption Law\n$A \\cup (A \\cap B) = A, A \\cap (A \\cup B) = A$\n![[Pasted image 20220928113436.png]]\n\n##### Complement Law\n$A \\cup \\bar A = U$\n$A \\cap \\bar A = \\emptyset$\n\n##### Commutative Law\n$A \\cup B = B \\cup A$\n$A \\cap B = B \\cap A$\n\n##### Associative Law\n$A \\cup (B \\cup C) = (A \\cup B) \\cup C)$\n$A \\cap (B \\cap C) = (A \\cap B) \\cap C)$\n\n##### Distributive Law\n$A \\cap (B \\cup C) = (A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\cap C)$\n$A \\cup (B \\cap C) = (A \\cup B) \\cap (A \\cup C)$\n\n##### De Morgan's Law\n![[Pasted image 20220928113859.png]]\n(Multi-character bars can't be displayed in Mathjax)\n\n\n##### Membership Table\nOne way of proving the equality of two set expressions is to use a membership table, similar to a [[Truth Table]].\n![[Pasted image 20220928114317.png]]\nThe table above proves De Morgan's Law of sets.\n\nThe preferred way of proving the equality of two set expressions is to use the definition of equal sets and the above set identities.\n\n\n## References\nTextbook 2.1 - Sets and 2.2 - Set Operations\nLecture notes page 15 lecture 6\n\n[[2022-09-23 CSCI243]] finishing proof methods, introducing sets\n[[2022-09-26 CSCI243]] cardinality, power set, cartesian product\n[[2022-09-28 CSCI243]] relation, set operations, set identities, membership table, trevtutor videos\n\nTrevTutor\n- [[2022-09-28 CSCI243#Vid 1 - TrevTutor Intro to Set Theory|Intro to Set Theory]]\n- [[2022-09-28 CSCI243#Vid 2 - TrevTutor Cartesian Products and Ordered Pairs|Cartesian Products and Ordered Pairs]]\n- [[2022-09-28 CSCI243#Vid 3 - TrevTutor Subsets and Power Sets|Subsets and Power Sets]]","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.440918278Z","tags":null},"/Topic-Notes/Story-of-Ying-ying":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #topic\ncreation date: [[2022-11-02 Wednesday]] 17:07:26\ndescription::\n\n## \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## References\nTextbook","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.440918278Z","tags":null},"/Topic-Notes/Summation":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #topic\ncreation date: [[2022-10-11 Tuesday]] 20:47:17\nmodification date: [[2022-10-11 Tuesday]] 20:47:17\n\n## Summations\nA summation is a sum of some terms.

Monday, Feb 28\n\n# Crime and Punishment\n\n## In class notes (2/28)\n### Dostoevsky\nFedor Dostoevsky 1821-81\nLived in St. Petersburg\nBecame part of a radicalizing group, read literature\nArrested and sentenced to execution by firing squad for free thinking\nAt the last moment, tzar commutes the sentence to 10 years of jail\nComes back to St. Petersburg a changed man, more cynical, progressive ideas watered down, becomes more religious\nReflected in prison, finding a path to salvation\nComes up with a hierarchy of sin\nThe worst sinners are not murderers, they can find redemption\nIf you do not believe in god, you only believe in yourself\nAtheists and child molesters are on par as the worst sinners\nC\u0026P is about one man dealing with murder and how it isn't clear cut\nDostoevsky was always in debt, money is important in his novels\n\nDostoevsky's crime novels\n- Crime and Punishment 1866 - Ideological murder, obsession with an idea\n- The Idiot 1868 - Murder of passion, jealousy\n- Demons 1872 - Political murder, emerging Russian terrorism\n- The Brothers Karamazov 1880 - Patricide\n\nDostoevsky's \"realism\" is \"fantastic\" realism\n- He pushed images and phenomena of everyday reality to the limits of the symbolic\n- Some consider Dostoevsky a realist but it is not all pure realism\n- Very melodramatic, very extreme situations of good and evil, lots of monologuing\n- Lots of coincidences, dream sequences\n- Symbolic realism / fantastic realism\n\nCalled the inventor of the \"polyphonic\" novel\n- Multiple \"idea-voices\" co-exist and compete with each other on their own terms without the author's judgment\n- Rashkolnikov is the battleground which these ideas compete in\n\nSymbolic names and titles\n- Prestuplenie i nakazanie (crime and punishment)\n\t- Prestuplenie = stepping over/crossing over a line, transgression\n- Rodion Ramonivich Raskolnikov\n\t- Raskol = schism, split, break away, cut off\n\t- He splits between emotions, he split away from society, the axe\n- Sonya / short for Sophia\n\t- Sophia = \"wisdom\" in Greek\n- Razumikhin\n\t- Razum = common sense, reasoning\n- Luzhin\n\t- puddle, \"Mr. Puddle\"\n\n### History of C\u0026P\n1866\nPublished in installments in the journal \"The Russian Messenger\"\nSome \"a priory\" thoughts on Dostoevsky and C\u0026P\n- Religious \u0026 philosophical writer\n- His novels are not neat, they sprawl\n- Stories are taking place in daily Russian life\n\n### Analysis\nNarrator\n- Is the narrator omniscient? \n\t- Limited omniscience, not first person\n- Does Dostoevsky base parts of the book on his own life?\n- What does Raskolnikov look like? \n\t- Dark hair, handsome, skinny, \"beautiful dark eyes,\" but ragged, doesn't care about his appearance\nSpace\n- Where is the novel set?\n\t- In St. Petersburg, hot summer, 1860s\n- How is Raskolnikov's room described?\n\t- Small, stuffy, low ceiling, \"more like a cupboard than a room\"\n\t- Metaphor for himself, a foil\n\t- Room = Raskolnikov's mind\n\t- Stuck living in the attic = trapped in his mind\nPrivacy\n- Open spaces\n- Living spaces not private\n- Eavesdropping\n- People coming and going from Raskolnikov's room\nTime\n- Crisis time (time moves slowly) vs. dream time (time moves quickly/loss of time)\n\t- Time can be stretched out, paragraphs are used to describe just a few seconds\n\t- Time can move quickly, a few sentences decribe a loss of time or a full period of time\n- Linear time vs. flashbacks\n- Book itself is fairly linear, does not jump around in time too much, but still has flashbacks and dream sequences\n\nMissed class on parts 3 and start of part 4\n\n##### Notes from in class discussion on parts 4, 5\n- dunya rejects luzhin\n- when people confess to someone they have a certain power over them\n- raskolnikov confession(s) to sonya\n- raskolnikov is terse to sonya\n- raskolnikov, the one confessing, has power\n- when svidrigailov confesses to raskolnikov, svidrigailov controls the conversation\n\t- \"birds of a feather\"\n- raskolnikov has a guilty conscience and svidrigailov is at peace with himself he is fine with his crimes\n- porfiry\n\t- confessions/interviews\n\t- porfiry has power over raskolnikov\n\t- \"he looks like a peasant woman\" quoting prof\n\t- strange description for a policeman\n\t- an unconventional detective\n\t- brings razumikin along to the first interview\n\t- raskolnikov uses razumikin in order to seem innocent\n\t- porfiry also uses people and plays games\n\t- its like death note!\n\t- \"On Crime\" written by raskolnikov\n\t- finds out raskolnikov wrote it by coincidence he knows the editor\n\t- raskolnikov talks about \"men vs louses\" \n\t- men with greater morals are allowed to transgress and break laws for the greater good\n\t- uses napoleon as an example\n\t- uses this writing to incriminate raskolnikov and get him talking\n\t- biblical reference: porfiry mentions lazarus\n\t- does raskolnikov win or lose this conversation?\n\t\t- raskolnikov recognizes the trap and knows he is under suspicion and is able to evade porfiry's games\n- second interview\n\t- porfiry is smirking, winking, acting strange, unconventional\n\t- talks about evidence and methods he uses, methods that police use to investigate, revealing his traps\n\t- porfiry believes in no system and no methods, it depends on the person being investigated\n\t- why doesnt he arrest raskolnikov?\n\t\t- he says that some people, you arrest them, and you give them stability\n\t\t- since he doesnt have stable evidence, he doesnt want to have raskolnikov in a cell, he would be stable and sitting there in a cell\n\t\t- porfiry wants him to continue the torture of living his life with his burden\n\t\t- this idea of a burden being lifted could be symbolic of lazarus\n\t- raskolnikov almost faints, porfiry offers him water, and raskolnikov refuses\n\t\t- symbolic of baptism\n\t- the guy hiding behind the door, porfiry's trump card, will claim that raskolnikov is guilty\n\t- just before, the painter comes in and confesses, surprising both raskolnikov and porfiry\n\t- the guy behind the door apologizes to raskolnikov\n\t\t- the innocent apologizing to theguilty\n\nlazarus\n- mentioned by porfiry, mentioned by sonya\n- parallels raskolnikov, rebirth, raskolnikov should confess to become reborn\n\nkahoot break\n\npart 5\nmarmeladov funeral after party is a mess, sonya accused of theft by luzhin, luzhin is proved guilty of framing her, ivanovna is evicted and dies after\n\nmoney\n- what role does money play in part 5?\n\t- Funeral dinner is organized with Raskolnikov's money (25 rubles)\n\t\t- done out of compassion\n\t- Luzhin wishes he gave Dunya some money\n\t\t- done maliciously as plan to win Dunya over\n\t- Luzhin gives money to Sonya (10 rubles) and slips more money in her pocket (100 rubles) and during the funeral dinner accuses Sonya of theft\n\t\t- done to implicate Sonya and blackmail Raskolnikov in exchange for Dunya\n\t\t- luzhin's roommate vouches for Sonya, Raskolnikov claims that Luzhin is framing Sonya in order to spite him\n\t- Svidrigailov gives money to Ivanovna's kids and her funeral and helps Sonya out of poverty\n\t\t- svidrigailov planned to give this money (10,000 rubles) to Dunya to look good to Raskolnikov, but gives them to Sonya now to spite Raskolnikov after finding he is guilty\n\t\t- he needs raskolnikov\n\nthe funeral\n- a wake, russian tradition\n- ivanovna is a proud woman\n- poor people, strangers show up for free food, the spectacle of the landlady vs ivanovna\n\t- germans and poles mentioned specifically\n- more \"noble\" people turn down the invite because of sonya\n- ivanovna gets angry\n- luzhin appears, is the person of highest stature at the wake\n- luzhin accuses sonya and she is surprised but feels resigned, she can't defend herself\n- raskolnikov is just watching\n- lebezaitnikov comes to sonyas defense\n\t- name means \"Mr. sycophant\"\n\t- luzhins roommate\n\t- called a socialist/nihilist\n\t\t- believes environment controls men, influences their actions\n\t\t- believes in sonya as she is breaking the status quo through prostitution\n\t- dostoevsky does not like socialists\n\t\t- women should leave a traditional family and be with multiple partners\n\t\t- he tries to sleep with sonya, and when she refuses, he gets her kicked out of the apartment, which is why she lives in a different building\n\t\t- rejects philanthropy and compassion\n\t- lebezaitnikov is a hypocrite parroting socialist rhetoric\n- the fact that lebezaitnikov speaks to Sonya's aid is a miracle - no one expects this from this character\n\t- he didn't know that he would become enraged and defend Sonya\n- described as having bad eye sight, so him seeing luzhin slip the money can also be seen as a miracle\n- once lebezaitnikov comes to sonya's defence, raskolnikov jumps in to defend as well\n\n- everyone scatters\n\t- ivanovna is evicted, makes a scene, taken to sonya's room, dies\n\t- raskolnikov goes to sonya's room, asks sonya to weight luzhin's life and the lives of her stepmother and the children\n\t- it is a simple question but still so difficult\n\t- she replies she is not the judge and she doesnt know gods path for luzhin\n\n\n### In class notes 3/21\n\nTwo conversations with Sonya\n- Power of confession talked about last time\n- Looks down on Sonya\n- Choose between luzhin and the children\n\t- Impossible choice, existential\n\t- Sonya abstains from the question, God makes these decisions\n\nHow are the two conversations the same?\n- In both R. is tyrannical abuses and torments Sonya\n\nHow are they different?\n- R. is fully in control \u003c-\u003e reason fails; he cries\n- \"We both transgressed we are the same\" \u003c-\u003e \"We are different\"\n\nSonya tells R. he needs to repent\n- Sonya is stronger than R.\n- She sees him as miserable\n- Go to the crossroads and confess\n\n- Can't confess because of his pride\n- Why would he confess to the people in the streets they are just as guilty as he is\n- Sonya says he doesn't need to confess for them, he needs to confess for himself\n\n- Sonya offers to give Lizaveta's cross to R. but he rejects it\n- When you exchange crosses in Russian Orthodox you become sisters and brothers in Christ\n\n\nPart 6\n\nAll about Raskolnikov making a choice\n\"Everything seems to be predetermined in this story, with chance encounters and coincidence\"\nWhat are Raskolnikov's options?\n- Porfiry comes to his home\n- Svidrigailov comes to his home\n\"R. is split between these two characters and their options\"\n- Porfiry (similar to Sonya): \n\t- knows R. did it\n\t- tells him to confess in two days or be arrested\n\t- tells him he is suffering and needs to accept fresh air\n\t- tells him he is sincere, in turmoil, he has a future but he has mistakes\n\t- confession means a lighter sentence\n\t- says that if he commits suicide, he should leave a note so that the other guy isn't persecuted\n- Svidrigailov: \n\t- \"you can live like this, I do\"\n\t- living beyond morality, beyond consciousness\n\t- \"everything is allowed; life beyond morality or suicide\"\n\t- R. will consider the option of suicide as not only a viable one but a preferable one, can still be a strong man\n\t- Svidrigailov kills himself in public\n\t- Svidrigailov tries to coax Dunya into killing him\n\t- He wants to take as many people with him to damnation\n\n\nDostoevsky on faith\n- see slide in blackboard\n\n\nEpilogue\n\nWhat is the narrative function of an epilogue?\n- closure\n\nIs the epilogue told in the same narrative tone as the rest of the novel?\n- told in one voice\n- third person, clear narration\n- knows what's right and wrong (unlike the rest of the novel)\n\nWhere?\n- Siberia\n\nTime in the novel vs. time in the epilogue\n- The six parts of the novel takes place over a week or two\n- The epilogue takes place over years\n\t- \"9 months pass\", alluding to birth, rebirth\n\t- Spiritual rebirth is happening in Spring, around Lent and Easter\n\n\"Novel switches

term comes from biology/anatomy\n\t\t- One of the first to try studying the parts of texts in a scientific way\n\t\t- Aarne and Thompson's motif index\n\t\t\t- A\u0026T created a classification of motifs\n\t\t\t- Aarne's basic typology -

1980s\n\t- \"it felt like we were unteachable\"\n\t- former students of MLK elementary school\n\t- kids were put into special education classes\n\t- \"language shouldn't stop them from being educated\"\n\t- lawsuit taken against the school\n\t- \"a small group of poor black children in a sea of affluent white families\"\n\t- \"language is the marker for assumed attitudes\"\n\t- \"led to a landmark court decision on Black English\"\n\t- \"judge confirmed that the school district was insensitive\"\n\n80% of public school teachers in the US are white women\ndiscrimination due to teachers unaware of dialect differences\nstill exists today\nAnn Arbor case was significant for linguistics, linguists testified, one of the first times linguistics was used outside of scholarly study\n\n\"Ebonics\" Archaic term for AAE\nSchools in Oakland recognized the issue, students were speaking AAE, teachers were having a difficult time teaching students how to write and take tests in a standard dialect\nWanted to teach teachers about AAE, wanted to help move students to standard dialect, teach more effectively\nGoal to have students code-switch, write/speak in standard dialect\nThe news claimed that Oakland was teaching students Ebonics, a new language, caused public outrage\nWow sounds familiar\n\nvideo clips from documentary \"The E Word\" (about Ebonics) 2015\n- ###### Oakland\n\t- \"it's very systematic\" (dialect)\n\t- \"they're not misusing American English\"\n\t- \"it's structured, children can only pick up language that is systematic\"\n\t- \"it's difficult to understand that people speak a language in different ways\"\n\t- \"languages differ, they are not inferior/superior\"\n\t- \"the relationships between language and inteliigence, decorum, appropriateness, have been naturalized, there is nothing inherent in what sounds appropriate\"\n\t- \"even the term dialect, used by linguists as a neutral term, has prejudice\"\n\t- \"language becomes high status, dialect is low status\"\n\t- \"one of the controversies of Ebonics was calling it a language and not a dialect\"\n\t- \"socially subordinate groups will always have their language seen as inferior\"\n\t- \"language is identity\"\n\t- \"the number one way we have to present ourselves through the world, form ideas\"\n\t- \"when you critique someone's language, you are critiquing them\"\n\t- \"you haven't earned the privilege to hear me talk any other way than the way I'm talking now\" code-switching\n\t- \"if you're talking to someone as if they're not human, what do you expect them to do?\"\n\n\"what does it mean that I can teach a class without code switching when others have to\"\n\"these ideas are applicable towards any variety of a language\"\n\"it's not about

already speaking AAE, our goal is to get everyone toward using a standard form\"\n\t- \"you can't condemn students for the way they speak\"\n\n### Linguistic Strategies for Teachers\nwhat would you want to tell a teacher to aid the way they teach linguistically?\n- understanding differences between standard English / other variants\n- all varieties are equally valid, none are better or worse, have their own rules/grammar\n- we all have a dialect, it's not something someone else has\n- certain varieties are less accepted than others\n- recognize demographics, and who was taught what standards\n- difficulty in being taught in a different standard than what is spoken at home\n- differences are not inherently deficits\n\n\n\n---\n\n### Related Topics\n- previous [[Language Variation

DET)\n- come before nouns\n- ex. \"the\" \"a\" \"this\" \"that\"\n- not an open category\n\n2. nouns (N)\n- open category\n\t- can invent new nouns\n- structurally can tell something is a noun differently from how we conceptually tell something is a noun\n\t- structurally, nouns can be made plural, can be replaced with pronouns\n\n3. adjectives (ADJ)\n- open category\n- structurally, is capable of coming between a determiner and a noun\n\t- ex. \"the reddish pen\"\n\t- \"reddish\" is the adjective and goes between \"the\" and \"pen\"\n- structurally, can be made comparative or superlative\n\t- \"redder\" \"reddest\" \"the most red\"\n\n4. verbs (V)\n- \"every language has verbs\"\n- open category\n- structurally, \u003cmark style=\"background: #FFB8EBA6;\"\u003emissed one lol\u003c/mark\u003e \n- structurally, can be put in past tense\n\n5. preposition (P)\n- ex. \"on\" \"by\" \"around\"\n- to test if a word is a preposition\n\t- \"right ___ the corner\"\n\t- \"right ___ determinant noun\"\n\nThere are likely more lexical categories in English that we will come across\n\n##### phrasal categories\nbuilt around a single word, called \"the head\" of the phrase\n1. Noun Phrase (NP)\n\t- a noun is the head of the phrase\n2. Prepositional Phrase (PP)\n\t- preposition head\n3. Verb Phrase (VP)\n\t- verb head\n4. Sentences (S)\n\n--- \n\n\"a woman walked the little dog down the street\"\nwe can agree this is an English sentence\ncan we figure out how sentences are put together and write rules for sentences using this sentence?\n\n### Constituency\nConstituents of a sentence are the parts of a sentence\n\"Constituents are strings of closely related words\"\n\nLooking at: \"a woman walked the little dog down the street\"\nWhat are the constituents?\n\nDET  N          V      DET ADJ  N      P     DET   N\n\"a woman walked the little dog down the street\"\n\n##### constituent tests\n1. Substitution test\nIf we can replace a group of words with one word, then we know that is a closely related string of words. There are different kinds of substitution:\n- Pronoun replacement\n\t- ex. replace \"the little dog\" with \"him\"\n\t- \"a woman walked him down the street\"\n\t- this shows that \"the little dog\" is a constituent\n\t- we can see that \"little\" is more related to \"dog\" than it is related to \"down\", for example\n\n- \"Prepositional proform\" replacement\n\t- this just means replacing \"there\" and \"then\"\n\t- want to try and stretch the substitution for as many words as possible to find a constituent\n\t- ex. replace \"down the street\" with \"there\"\n\t- \"a woman walked the little dog there\"\n\t- this is as far as you can stretch the substitution without changing the meaning\n\t- \"a woman walked there\" would change the meaning too much\n\t- \"a woman walked the little dog down there\" can still stretch the substitution farther\n\n- \"do so\" \"did so\" replacement\n\t- ex. replace \"walked the little dog down the street\" with \"did so\"\n\t- \"a woman did so\"\n\t- this is as far as you can stretch the subtitution without changing the meaning\n\n\n2. Movement test\nTry moving a group of words to the front of the sentence in order to find constituents\n- ex. move \"down the street\" to the front\n- \"down the street, a woman walked the little dog\"\n- ex. move \"the little dog\"\n- \"the little dog, the woman walked down the street\"\n- these sentences could exist in a conversation\n- if the second example does not feel right to a listener, we can still see that \"the little dog\" is a constituent from the pronoun replacement test\n\n\n3. Wh? test\nAsk a \"who, what, when, where\" question, and the answer is a constituent\n- ex. \"who walked the little dog down the street?\"\n\t- a woman\n- ex. \"a woman walked what down the street?\"\n\t- the little dog\n- ex. \"a woman walked the little dog where?\"\n\t- down the street\n- The answer is exactly what was substituted\n\n\nNow, we analyze these constituents and their relations in order to make rules\n\n\n### Phrase Structure Rules\nHow are these phrases put together? What rules allow a speaker to generate these phrases?\nParentheses means optional\n\n##### NP - Noun Phrases\n- (Determinant) - (Adjective) - Noun\n- Determinant before the noun\n- If there's an adjective, it goes between the determinant and noun\n- Determinants and adjectives are both optional, could be just a noun in a noun phrase\n\n##### PP - Prepositional Phrases\n- Preposition - (Determinant) - (Adjective) - (Noun)\n- aka Preposition - Noun Phrase\n- We can show how these phrases enclose each other\n\n##### VP - Verb Phrases\n- Verb - (Noun Phrase) - (Prepositional Phrase)\n- Only verb is essential but the optional parts are used in this order\n\n##### S - Sentence\n- Noun Phrase - Verb Phrase\n\n##### Summary:\nNP -\u003e (Det) (Adj) N (PP)\nPP -\u003e P NP\nVP -\u003e V

share the same \"mother,\" the noun phrase node\n- can find patterns between sisters/mothers/nieces/cousins/etc\n- kinship terms use feminine markers because reasons\n\n##### grammatical roles\nSubject/Object?\n- Subject is who \"does\" something in a sentence\n- \"Carlo kicked the trash can\"\n- But a passive voice reverses this, so how do we determine what the subject is\n- \"The trash can was kicked by Carlo\"\n\nSubject/Object Definitions\n- Define the subject as the NP that is the daughter of the S\n- The direct object is the NP that is the daughter of the VP\n- Object of

Prolegomenon\n- \"Tale of bygone years\"\n- Sons of Noah\n\t- Shem, Ham, and Japeth\n\t- Divided the earth\n\t- Shem claimed the Orient: India, Rhinocorura, Persia, Bactria, Syria, Media, Euphrates River, Babylon, Assyria, Mesopotamia, Arabia, Phoenicia, etc\n\t- Ham claimed the southern region: Egypt, Ethiopia, Ethiopian river, Libya, some regions of the Orient, Sardinia, Crete, Cyprus, Nile River, etc\n\t- Japheth claimed the northern and western sections: Albania, Armenia, Macedonia, the Slavs, Adriatic Sea, Britain, Sicily, Ithaca, Ionia, Tigris river, Hungary, etc\n\t- Japheth also claimed Russia, Chud, Prussia, Varangian Sea, Sweden, Norway, Rus, Italy, Rome, Greece, Germany, Venice, Genoa, the Angles, etc.\n- Tower of Babel\n\t- One language before\n\t- Planned to build a tower as high as heaven itself\n\t- God didn't like the tower\n\t- Divided the people into 72 races and scattered them across the world\n\t- And destroyed the tower\n- After the tower's destruction\n\t- The sons of Shem occupied the eastern regions\n\t- The sons of Ham occupied the south\n\t- The sons of Japheth occupied the west and north\n\t- \"Among these 72 nations, the Slavic race is derived from the line of Japheth, since they are the Noricians, who are identical with the Slavs.\"\n- The Slavs\n\t- Split off into other subgroups\n\t- \"Thus the Slavic race was divided, and its language was known as Slavic.\"\n- Skipping the last parts of this its more geographical explanation of nothing\n\n\n2. The Apostle Andrew Comes to Russia\n- 10th or 11th century Apostle Andrew visited the territories that would become Russia on his trip to the Greek colonies on the Black Sea\n- This legend laid the foundation for the later theory of Russia as the guardian of the Orthodox Christian faith\n- He predicts a great city being built or whatevs and later Kiev is built there\n- Reached the Slavs\n- Observed how they bathed\n- \"They warm themselves to extreme heat, then undress, and after anointing themselves with tallow, they take young reeds and lash their bodies. They actually lash themselves so violently that they barely escape alive. Then they drench themselves with cold water, and thus are revived. They think nothing of doing this every day, and actually inflict such voluntary torture upon themselves.\"\n\n\n3. The Founding of the City of Kiev\n- Founded by three brothers, Kii, Schek, and Khoriv\n- One of the oldest historical legends of Russia\n- Sister named Lybed\n- The brothers lived on three separate hills\n- Built a town and named it Kiev after their oldest brother\n- Polianians were the original founders of Kiev\n- Some think Kii was a ferryman but this text vehemently disagrees\n- All three brothers and their sister lived their whole lives in Kiev\n\n\n4. The Beginning of the Russian State and the Arrival of Rurik\n- The Russians called the Vikings the Varangians\n- Difficult to determine how important Varangian settlers were to the organization of the Russian state\n- \"The Chronicle records that Rurik, the leader of a group of Varangians, was invited to rule over Novgorod in 862, and legend has it that Rurik became the founder of both the Russian state and the dynasty that ruled Russia until 1598, when Fedor, the son of Ivan IV, died without an heir.\"\n- Scholars can't decide if Rurik founded the state or if it was there long before him\n- The Slavs drove out the tribes that demanded tribute of them and decided to govern themselves\n- Infighting ensued\n- The tribes (The Chuds, the Slavs, and the Krivichians) began to seek \"a prince who may rule over us\"\n- Went to the Varangian Rus and found three brothers to rule them and the bros migrated all the Rus and settled in different places\n\t- Eldest brother Rurik in Novgorod\n\t- Second brother Sineus in Beloozero\n\t- Third brother Truvor in Izborsk\n- The district of Novgorod became Russian (Rus) land\n- Sineus and Truvor died after two years and Rurik assumed authority\n- Boring stuff\n- Rurik's boyars find Kiev long after the three brothers who built it passed on\n- Eventually Rurik gained rule of Kiev\n- Something something invading Constantinople idc next story\n\n\n5. Prince Olec's Campaign Against Constantinople\n- Rurik died in 879 leaving his affairs to Oleg, in view of the infancy of Rurik's son, Igor\n- 882 Oleg moves capital from Novgorod to Kiev\n- Oleg consolidated many Slavic tribes\n- 907 Oleg attacks the Greeks\n- They attached wheels to their ships and \"when the wind was favorable they spread the sails and bore down upon the city from the open country\"\n\t- That is sick\n- Russians made peace with Greeks on their terms but they are boring ships and people and money and whatever\n- They make peace and the Greeks kiss the cross and Oleg swore to his weapons and his God or whatever\n- \"The people called Oleg 'the Seer,' for they were but pagans, and therefore ignorant.\"\n\n\n6. The Death of Oleg\n- His magicians tell him that his horse will cause his death\n- The horse dies years later and he thinks he's defeated death\n- He goes to see the horse's remains and stomps on the skull triumphantly but gets bit by a snake in the skull and dies\n- Lollllll\n\n\n7. Igor's Death and Olga's Revenge\n- Igor becomes ruler\n- Not the best\n- Died skirmishing at present-day Polish border\n- His widow revenged him\n- This story is close to a folklore's motifs\n- Whatevs she gets revenge burns a village down kills everyone\n\n\n\n21. The Martyrdom of Boris and Gleb\n- Do I need to read this part\n\n\n22. The Beginning of the Kievan Crypt Monastery and its Founder, St. Antonius\n- Do I read this too\n- Whatevs I'm tired I'm going back to the dorm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##### In-class notes\nDifference from modern historical writing?\n- Uses religion\n\nYears\n- Uses Byzantine calendars\n\nAuthor\n- Multiple authors but the work isn't \"claimed\" by any one author\n- They were scribes of God's word!\n- Authorless\n\nSummary\n- Colophone\n- Feudal wars\n- Tower of babel\n- Various tribes\n\t- One called Rus, a Nordic tribe\n- Godless Russians\n\t- Pagans and not Christians\n- Ends with an extensive prayer\n- The great Christian nation\n- Centralization\n- Fratricide\n- Imitation of Christ\n- Kenotic\n\t- Non resistance the model of sainthood imitation of Jesus\n- St. Andrew came to Russia and saw people beating themselves with sticks in the bathhouse\n- Extremely hot sauna getting your friend to beat you senseless with twigs and then jump into cold water\n\t- It's good for circulation!\n- Called on vikings to rule\n\t- Rurik Dynasty ruled Russia 9th century until end of 16th century\n\t- Then Romanoffs ruled\n\t- Then Mongols (?)\n- Terrible revenge\n\t- Igor's wife, Olga, avenged Igor by torturing the people that killed him\n\t- Lots of burning people\n\t- Pigeons and sparrows with burning cloth tied to them burned down \n\t- Pigeon revenge!\n\t- And she became a saint","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.444918249Z","tags":null},"/Topic-Notes/Topic-Notes-Freshman-Spring/Trigonometric-Integrals":{"title":"","content":"Tags: \\#flashcards/calc2 #notes #MATH112\nCreated: Wednesday, Feb 16\n(disabled flashcard tag)\n# 7.2 Trigonometric Integrals\n\n### In-class notes Wednesday, Feb 16\nTrig Identity\n$sin^2x + cos^2x = 1$\n\nex.\n$cos^3x = cos^2x * cosx$\n$cos^3x = (1-sin^2x) cosx$\n$\\int cos^3xdx = \\int (1-sin^2x) cosxdx$\nu = sinx\ndu = cosxdx\n$\\int cos^3xdx = \\int (1-u^2) du$\n$\\int cos^3xdx = u - \\frac 1 3 u^3 + C$\n$\\int cos^3xdx = sinx - \\frac 1 3 sin^3x + C$\n\nex 2 i wont write it all out but its $\\int sin^7x cos^5xdx$\nu substitution is like figuring out how to remove the du from the equation in this situation its cosx so you are working only in terms of u which is sinx here\n\nThis technique works well when the power on sinx or cosx is odd\nTake the one with the odd power, take off one power, use that as du, use trig identity for the leftover even power to get in terms of the other function\n\nWhat if powers on sinx and cosx are both even?\nFirst use double-angle identities!\n\nDouble angle identities\n$cos^2x = \\frac {1 + cos2x} 2$\n$sin^2x = \\frac {1-cos2x} 2$\n\nSo,\n$\\int cos^2xdx = \\int \\frac {1 + cos2x} 2 dx$\n$\\int cos^2xdx = \\frac 1 2 \\int (1 + cos2x)dx$\nDo u = 2x du = 2 u substitution\nOr just know that the antiderivative would be $\\frac 1 2 sin2x$ for cos2x\n$\\int cos^2xdx = \\frac 1 2 (x + \\frac 1 2 sin2x) + C$\n\nNext example $\\int cos^2x sin^2xdx$\nUse the double angle identities on both take out a 1/4 it's like a difference of squares $cos^22x = \\frac {1+cos4x} 2$ whateverrr I got lost\n\n\nMore circle identities\nTake $sin^2x + cos^2x = 1$ and divide everything by $cos^2x$\nBecomes\n$tan^2x + 1 = sec^2x$\nDivide by $sin^2x$ and it becomes\n$1 + cot^2x = csc^2x$\n\nCan't remember trig derivatives?

Constant force\nWhat is the work done in lifting a book of mass 12kg to a height of 0.7m?\n\nforce is force of gravity: $F = mg$ (g is the acceleration of gravity, = $9.8m/s^2$)\n\n$F = (12)(9.8) = 117.6N$ (N = newtons, $1N = 1kgm/s^2$)\n\n$W = (117.6)(0.7) = 82J$ (J = joules, $1J = 1N*m = 1kgm^2/s^2$)\n\n2. What if force isn't constant?\nPush a box across the ground from a to b with force F(x)\nThis is a continuous function\nCan break up $[a,b]$ into $n$ intervals and approximate the Work on each small interval\n$W_{i} = F(x_{i}^{*})\\Delta x$\n$= \\int_{a }^{b}F(x)dx$\n\n3. Hooke's Law\nFind work done stretching a spring from 16cm to 21cm fiven thaht it naturally rests at 10cm and takes 30N to hold it at 13cm.\n\nHooke's Law: F(x) = kx\nk is \"spring constant\" and x is distance past resting state\n\n30N to hold at 13cm aka 3cm past resting state or 0.03m\n$30 = F(0.03)$\n$30 = k * (0.03)$\n$k = 1000$ (k is the spring constant)\n$F(x) = 1000 x$ (x is in meters and F is in Newtons)\n\n$W = \\int_{0.06}^{0.11}1000xdx$ (stretching from 6cm past resting state to 11cm past resting state)\n$= 500x^2 from 0.06 to 0.11$\n$= 4.25 J$\n\n4. Gravity\n50lb cable 25ft long hanging vertically from the ledge of a building. How much work does it take to lift the cable up to the top of the ledge?\nIt takes less and less force to pull the remainder of the cable up as the process goes on\nIdea: break up into $n$ small pieces (think of links in a chain) of thickness $\\Delta x = \\frac {25} n ft$ .\nThe weight of each piece is $\\frac {50} n lb$.\nIn terms of $\\Delta x$, each piece weighs $2\\Delta x$\nTo lift the $i$th piece, $W_i = F*d = 2\\Delta x * x_i^*$ (pretend its an approx. equals sign)\n($x_i^*$ is how far up each \"chain\" will need to travel)\n$W =\\sum_{i=1}^n 2\\Delta x * x_i^* = \\sum_{i=1}^n (2x_i^*)\\Delta x$\n$W = \\int_{0}^{25}2xdx$\n$= 25^2 ft*lb$\nEnds with a really simple integral, but it's difficult to visualize and flesh out\n\n5. Pump water\nFind work needed to pump water out of a full cylindrical tank with given dimensions out of a spout 2m above the tank.\nHeight of tank 8m\nRadius of tank 3m\n\nIdea: cut up into n slices. Taking horizontal slices of water, each point in the slice needs to move up the same distance to the top of the tank. Find the work done on each slice.\nThink of the origin in the coordinate plane as the top of the tank going down to the bottom of the tank at $y = 8$\n$\\Delta y = \\frac 8 n$\nForce on $i$th slice: $F_i = m*g$ (g is gravity)\nMass (of slice) = density (of water) * volume (of slice in tank) = $1000kg/m^3 * \\pi (3)^2 \\Delta y$\n$F = 1000 \\pi (3)^2 \\Delta y * 9.8$\n\n\n6. Pump water out of a sphere\nPumping water out a full spherical tank\nRadius of tank 3m\nThrough a spout above the tank\nSpout of 1m above the tank\nBreak up into small pieces; \"That's our main idea of calculus\"\n\nPut x=0 at the middle of the tank x increasing as you go up like usual (and not like the other examples)\n\nMake horizontal slices to make circles but need to find the radius of these circles to find volume of each slice\n\n$V = \\pi r^2 \\Delta y$\n\nUse [[Trigonometry|triangle magic]] to find radius\nBase of triangle is y\nHeight is r\nHypotenuse is radius of the sphere\n\nWe put x=0 at the center of the sphere so that the base would be y and the triangle magic would be pretty\n\n$r^2 + y^2 = 3^2$\n$r = \\sqrt{9-y^2}$\n$V = \\pi (9-y^2) \\Delta y$\n\n$F = mg = pVg = \\pi pg (9-y^2) \\Delta y$ (p is the density of water $1000 kg/m^3$ and g is gravity $9.8m/s^2$)\n\nThen the water has to travel $4 - y$ to get to the top of the spout\n\n$d = 4 - y$\n\n$W = \\pi pg (9-y^2)(4 - y) \\Delta y$ (for a slice at y)\n\n$W = \\int_{-3}^{3} \\pi pg (9-y^2)(4 - y)dy$\n\n7. What if we only pumped out water until the height of the water remaining was 2/3 the original height? (Continuation from last example)\nThe limits of integration are the only part that would change\n\n$W = \\int_{1}^{3} \\pi pg (9-y^2)(4 - y)dy$\n\n8. What if tank was only filled to 1/3 its height to begin with, and then we pump all of that water out?\nThe limits of integration are the only part that would change\n\n$W = \\int_{-3}^{-1} \\pi pg (9-y^2)(4 - y)dy$\n\n\n\n### Detailed Definition\n*Theorem 1:*\n$$\n\\displaystyle \\int_{-a }^{a}f(x)dx = 2\\int_{ 0 }^{a}f(x)dx\n$$\n\n\n---\n### Flashcards\n- \n\n\n### Related Topics\n- [[Integration]]","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.444918249Z","tags":null},"/Topic-Notes/Travels-in-Manchuria-and-Mongolia":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #topic #reading\ncreation date: [[2022-09-22 Thursday]] 14:05:28\nmodification date: [[2022-09-22 Thursday]] 14:05:28\n\n## Travels in Manchuria and Mongolia\nread up to page 64\n\n\n\n\n## References\n[[2022-09-22 JAPN208]]","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.444918249Z","tags":null},"/Topic-Notes/Truth-Table":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #topic\ncreation date: [[2022-09-14 Wednesday]] 12:12:23\nmodification date: [[2022-09-14 Wednesday]] 12:12:23\n\n## Truth Tables\nTruth tables represent how [[Logical Operator|Logical Operators]] modify propositions\n\nBelow are all the tables we have encountered in class\n\n##### not truth table\n![[Pasted image 20220902112014.png]]\n\n##### and, or truth table\n![[Pasted image 20220902112147.png]]\n\n##### xor truth table\nthis table also shows how XOR can be represented with and, or, \u0026 not operators\n![[Pasted image 20220902112721.png]]\n\n##### implication truth table\nthis table also shows how implication can be represented with and, or, \u0026 not operators\n![[Pasted image 20220902114512.png]]\n\n##### equivalence truth table\nthis table also shows how equivalence is the conjunction of implication\nif p and q are the same, then true\n![[Pasted image 20220907111315.png]]\n\n\nProving equivalences through truth tables can become very time consuming, so we define algebraic, [[Logical Law|Logical Laws]] that can be used to simplify compound propositions and prove equivalence.\n\n## References\n[[2022-09-02 CSCI243]] and, or, xor, implication\n[[2022-09-07 CSCI243]] equivalence, explaining implication's other representations\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.444918249Z","tags":null},"/Topic-Notes/Unbeaten-Tracks-In-Japan":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #topic #reading\ncreation date: [[2022-09-08 Thursday]] 14:06:02\nmodification date: [[2022-09-08 Thursday]] 14:06:02\n\n## Unbeaten Tracks In Japan\nlecture - [[2022-09-08 JAPN208#Encounter]]\ndiscussion - [[2022-09-13 JAPN208]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## References\nreading annotations in goodnotes","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.444918249Z","tags":null},"/Topic-Notes/Uniqueness":{"title":"","content":"tags: #notes #topic\ncreation date: [[2022-09-05 Monday]] 21:34:08\nmodification date: [[2022-09-05 Monday]] 21:34:08\n\n1.1\n\n## Uniqueness\n\nA solution set of a [[Linear System]] is considered unique if it is the only solution set of that linear system.\n\nOne way to tell that a solution set is unique is whether the linear system contains [[Free Variable|Free Variables]].

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to render callouts\nenableCallouts: true\n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.444918249Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4.

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden. It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of your local files.\n\nThis step is **highly recommended**.\n\n\u003e 🔗 Step 3: [How to setup your Obsidian Vault to work with Quartz](notes/obsidian.md)\n\n## Previewing Changes\nThis step is purely optional and mostly for those who want to see the published version of their digital garden locally before opening it up to the internet.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated!\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first.

This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T04:24:30.448918221Z","tags":null},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
