Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜÿ™Ÿä'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T05:29:43.028267687Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Under Options \u003e Files and Links, set the New link format to always use Absolute Path in Vault.\n2. Go to Settings \u003e Files \u0026 Links \u003e Turn \"on\" automatically update internal links.\n\n![Obsidian Settings](/notes/images/obsidian-settings.png)*Obsidian Settings*\n\n## Templates\nInserting front matter everytime you want to create a new Note gets annoying really quickly. Luckily, Obsidian supports templates which makes inserting new content really easily.\n\n**If you decide to overwrite the `/content` folder completely, don't remove the `/content/templates` folder!**\n\nHead over to Options \u003e Core Plugins and enable the Templates plugin. Then go to Options \u003e Hotkeys and set a hotkey for 'Insert Template' (I recommend `[cmd]+T`). That way, when you create a new note, you can just press the hotkey for a new template and be ready to go!\n\n\u003e üëÄ Step 4: [Preview Quartz Changes](notes/preview%20changes.md)","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T05:29:43.032267745Z","tags":null},"/notes/philosophy":{"title":"Quartz Philosophy","content":"\n\u003e ‚Äú[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.‚Äù ‚Äî Richard Hamming\n\n## Why Quartz?\nHosting a public digital garden isn't easy. There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1. It's nice to access notes from anywhere\n2. Having a public digital garden invites open conversations\n3. It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*\n\nI was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.\n\n**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website. Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T05:29:43.032267745Z","tags":null},"/notes/preview-changes":{"title":"Preview Changes","content":"\nIf you'd like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, the following\ninstructions guide you through installing the proper dependencies to run it locally.\n\n\n## Install `hugo-obsidian`\nThis step will generate the list of backlinks for Hugo to parse. Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\n\n```bash\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\ngo install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\n```\n\nIf you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated!\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e [!INFO] Docker Support\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have Docker installed already, open your terminal, navigate to your folder with Quartz and run `make docker`\n\nNow that you are happy with how your Quartz instance looks, let's get it hosted!\n\n\u003e üåç Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](notes/hosting.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T05:29:43.032267745Z","tags":null},"/notes/search":{"title":"Search","content":"\nQuartz supports two modes of searching through content.\n\n## Full-text\nFull-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index.

If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\nüìÅ [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat!

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T05:29:43.032267745Z","tags":null},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?

When someone acts in accordance with the Dao, they follow the flow of reality, act at the right time, do not persue knowledge, and avoid desire.\n- In the writings of Zhuangzi, a butcher has a strong enough connection to the Way that he can cut an ox with perfect precision. The butcher is not a scholar, yet has honed his craft to such an extent that he has formed a connection to the Way.\n- Zhuangzi also uses immortality, flying on clouds, and other supernatural abilities to describe those close to the Way. These ideas were likely used as metaphors, but many people who practiced Daoism after Zhuangzi's time believed they could attain these powers.\n- This interpretation of the Way as a means of cultivating power is seen even today in fiction genres like progression fantasy, xianxia, and wuxia. These works typically have magic systems and stories that revolve around individuals cultivating power and becoming strong enough to manipulate reality.\n- The biggest and most accessible work from this category of fiction is Will Wight's *Cradle* series.\n- *Cradle*'s influence from Daoist ideas is explicit: the magic system is based on a force called The Way.\n- In the series, The Way makes reality stable and creates order. \n- It is strengthened by the presence of humans and other forms of intelligent life, and places in the universe with a high concentration of people have a stronger connection to the Way.\n- People with extremely strong wills are able to tap into the Way and manipulate reality. Typically, once they are able to do this, they are too powerful for their homeworld and must \"ascend.\" Without too many spoilers, the protagonist's goal in *Cradle* is to cultivate his willpower to this level.\n- This cultivation is what the series focuses on, and it comes in many facets. Typically this is done through strengthening one's spirit by cultivating aura and advancing through stages of strength. The people who perform these practices are called sacred artists. \n- By the Lord stage, the final stage before being able to attune to the Way, sacred artists must not only cultivate physical strength, but look inwards and find revelations about themselves. \n- After these revelations are found, sacred artists may manifest icons. Icons represent the identity and peak of skill a sacred artists has reached. \n- Much like the butcher who can attune to the Way and perfectly cut an ox, these sacred artists can tap into the Way in order to manipulate reality in ways that attune with their identity. As a sacred artist comes closer to the Way, they perfect their very identity, and the weight of their existence can warp the fabric of reality.\n- Much like the ideas of immortality than Zhuangzi mentioned, those that follow the Way in *Cradle* are able to become one with it.\n\n\"There are a million Paths in this world, Lindon, but any sage will tell you they can all be reduced to one.

distant reading\n- My goal was to take a large collection of Tang poetry and find what characters showed up most frequently throughout the works.\n\nFinding the poems\n- I wanted to find a large collection of Tang poetry, in .txt form, containing the poets we discussed in class\n- Found a collection called *Three Hundred Tang Poems*\n- Project Gutenberg had a .txt version in Chinese and an audio version with an English table of contents.\n\t- https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52323\n\t- https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20968\n- Using the English table of contents (and Google Translate), I found that this work contained some of the poets we discussed in class, such as Li Bai, Du Fu, and Wang Wei\n- Isolated just the poetry and used that as the data set\n\nMaking the Wordclouds\n- started by making a wordcloud\n- https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud\n- https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/auto_examples/wordcloud_cn.html\n- First wordcloud, no formatting, wanted to see what stuck out\n\t- Biggest strings of characters were author names\n- Next wordcloud, separated each character so that the wordcloud would represent character frequency instead\n- realized i cant make any sense of this so i need to print the most common characters\n\nTranslating to English and Refining the Data\n- In order to analyze these characters I needed to translate them to English, so I used another script to give me the most frequent characters and how often they appear.\n- I found that author names were one source of data contamination, and removed them from the .txt file\n- Google Translate definitely was not able to translate some characters properly, but this list still conveys some of the common themes used in the 300 poems\n\nThemes\n- Nature, seen through words like Sun, Night, Sky, Wind, Cloud, Green, Autumn, Horse\n\t- A theme we first found prevalent in poetry from the Six Dynasties Period\n\t- Continues into this dynasty, such as in the nature descriptions Du Fu uses in poems like *A Song on How My Thatched Roof Was Ruined by the Autumn Wind*\n\t- Mountain is much higher than I thought it would be\n- Passage of time, seen through words like Month, Year, Ancient, Today, Sun, Night, Autumn, Long, Time\n- Dao/Way, mentioned 50 times\n\t- We've talked about Daoism in class, and it's interesting to see it show up so frequently in these poems\n\t- Is it being mentioned by multiple poets, or one or two poets that focused on Daoism?\n\t\t- After looking through the data, mentions of ÈÅì are pretty spread out\n\t\t- Poems are organized by author for the most part, so no, it must be from multiple poets\n- No mentions of wine/drinking\n\t- I thought we'd see more because of its frequent mention in Li Bai's

My goal for this reflection was to take a large collection of Tang poetry and analyze it through distant reading by looking at word frequency.\n\n##### Finding poems\nI wanted to find a large collection of Tang poetry, in .txt form, containing the poets we discussed in class. Fortunately I was able to find a collection quickly called *Three Hundred Tang Poems*. Project Gutenberg had a .txt version in Chinese and an audio version with an English table of contents. Using the English table of contents (and Google Translate), I found that this work contained some of the poets we discussed in class, such as Li Bai, Du Fu, and Wang Wei. I downloaded the .txt and cut it down to just the poems to create the data set.\n\n##### Making the wordclouds\nI started by running the poems through a script to create a wordcloud showing the most frequent strings of characters as larger. The first wordcloud I created was to make sure the script was working.\n\n![[Pasted image 20221022230416.png]]\n\nI wasn't able to discern much from this graphic. The wordcloud was showing the most frequent combinations of characters instead of the most frequent characters. So next, I split the .txt file by character and made another wordcloud.\n\n![[Pasted image 20221022231246.png]]\n\nRemoving collocations, reducing number of characters shown to 100:\n\n![[Pasted image 20221022232153.png]]\n\nThis graphic was more useful, but at this point I realized I don't speak Chinese, so I needed a way of translating these characters. To do this, I made another script that printed the most frequent characters along with how many times they appeared.\n\n```\n100 most common characters and their frequencies\n\n[('Ôºå', 1580), ('„ÄÇ', 1321), ('‰Ωú', 351), ('ËÄÖ', 346), ('Ôºö', 322), ('Ô•ß', 222), ('‰∫∫', 214), ('Â±±', 175), ('1', 172), ('0', 170), ('2', 163), ('Ôºü', 151), ('ÁÑ°', 134), ('‰∏Ä', 133), ('Êúà', 130), ('Êó•', 127), ('Ôºõ', 123), ('Â§ú', 120), ('Â§©', 120), ('È¢®', 117), ('ÁôΩ', 117), ('Èï∑', 112), ('Ô§≠', 105), ('Èõ≤', 104), ('‰∏ä', 102), ('Êúâ', 98), ('Êò•', 95), (7', 94), ('‰Ωï', 92), ('Ô®à', 92), ('‰πã', 91), ('Áîü', 91), ('Âêõ', 90), ('Ôß°', 87), ('‰∏≠', 87), ('Ê∞¥', 87), ('Ô®ä', 85), ('Ëä±', 85), ('ÊôÇ', 84), ('Áéã', 84), ('3', 83), ('‰∏ã', 79), ('Èùí', 79), ('Ê≠∏', 78), ('Â¶Ç', 78), ('Áßã', 75), ('Êòé', 72), ('Ëê¨', 72), ('‰∏â', 71), ('ÁÇ∫', 71), ('Ô§ò', 71), ('Á©∫', 70), ('Ëá™', 67), ('Ê≠§', 64), ('Ô§ä', 63), ('Èõ®', 63), ('4', 62), ('5', 62), ('6', 62), ('7', 62), ('8', 62), ('9', 62), ('Âéª', 62), ('‰ªä', 61), ('È¶¨', 60), ('Âçó', 59), ('Êùú', 59), ('Âüé', 59), ('Ê¨≤', 59), ('ÂÆ∂', 58), ('Â∞á', 58), ('Ë•ø', 58), ('Âè§', 58), ('Ô¶é', 58), ('Êú™', 57), ('Â≠ê', 57), ('ÈñÄ', 57), ('Âú®', 56), ('ÂøÉ', 56), ('Ê∏Ö', 56), ('È£õ', 56), ('ÂØí', 56), ('ËÅ≤', 56), ('ÂÆ¢', 55), ('‰∫ã', 54), ('Ëôï', 54), ('Âà•', 54), ('Êúù', 54), ('È´ò', 53), ('ÈôΩ', 53), ('ÈªÉ', 52), ('Áéâ', 51), ('Â§ß', 51), ('ÂÖ•', 50), ('Ëàá', 50), ('Âá∫', 50), ('ÈÅì', 50), ('Êúõ', 49), ('ÂçÅ', 49)]\n\nRan through Google Translate\n\n[(',', 1580), ('.', 1321), ('do', 351), ('who', 346), (':', 322), ('no', 222), ( 'person', 214), ('mountain', 175), ('1', 172), ('0', 170), ('2', 163), ('?', 151), ('none ', 134), ('one', 133), ('month', 130), ('day', 127), (';', 123), ('night', 120), ('day', 120), ('wind', 117), ('white', 117), ('long', 112), ('come', 105), ('cloud', 104), ('on', 102) , ('you', 98), ('spring', 95), ('jiang', 95), ('xiang', 94), ('he', 92), ('line', 92), ( 'zhi', 91), ('sheng', 91), ('jun', 90), ('li', 87), ('zhong', 87), ('water', 87), ('see ', 85), ('flower', 85), ('time', 84), ('king', 84), ('3', 83), ('lower', 79), ('green', 79), ('Return', 78), ('Ru', 78), ('Autumn', 75), ('Ming', 72), ('Wan', 72), ('Three', 71) , ('wei', 71), ('fall', 71), ('empty', 70), ('si', 67), ('this', 64), ('jin', 63), ( 'rain', 63), ('4', 62), ('5', 62), ('6', 62), ('7', 62), ('8', 62), ('9 ', 62), ('go', 62), ('now', 61), ('ma', 60), ('nan', 59), ('du', 59), ('city', 59), ('desire', 59), ('home', 58), ('will', 58), ('west', 58), ('ancient', 58), ('year', 58) , ('wei', 57), ('zi', 57), ('door', 57), ('zai', 56), ('xin', 56), ('clear', 56), ( 'Fly', 56), ('Cold', 56), ('Sound', 56), ('Guest', 55), ('Thing', 54), ('Location', 54), ('Don't ', 54), ('towards' , 54), ('High', 53), ('Yang', 53), ('Yellow', 52), ('Jade', 51), ('Big', 51), ('In', 50 ), ('and', 50), ('out', 50), ('dao', 50), ('look', 49), ('ten', 49)]\n```\n\nNext, I spent a while trying to format the data to make a graph (with the first two most common characters, the comma and period, removed):\n\n![[Pasted image 20221022191816.png]]\n\nThen I realized that some of the characters in the list were from the names of the authors, which got left in the dataset. I also realized that Google Translate was combining some of the characters and the translation was fluctuating from instance to instance, so I added periods between each word in the word list and translated it in sections, making sure I got 100 English words to match the 100 characters. Eventually, I had this list:\n\n```\n[('Ôºå', 1580), ('„ÄÇ', 1321), ('Ô•ß', 222), ('‰∫∫', 213), ('Â±±', 175), ('1', 172), ('0', 170), ('2', 163), ('Ôºü', 151), ('‰∏Ä', 133), ('ÁÑ°', 133), ('Êúà', 130), ('Êó•', 127), ('Ôºõ', 123), ('Â§ú', 120), ('Â§©', 120), ('È¢®', 117), ('Ô§≠', 105), ('Èõ≤', 104), ('‰∏ä', 102), ('Èï∑', 101), ('Êúâ', 98), ('Ê±ü', 95), ('Êò•', 94), ('Áõ∏', 94), ('‰Ωï', 92), ('Ô®à', 92), ('Áîü', 91), ('Âêõ', 90), ('‰πã', 88), ('Ê∞¥', 87), ('‰∏≠', 86), ('Ô®ä', 85), ('Ëä±', 85), ('ÊôÇ', 84), ('3', 83), ('‰∏ã', 79), ('Èùí', 79), ('Ê≠∏', 78), ('Â¶Ç', 78), ('ÁôΩ', 77), ('Áßã', 74), ('Êòé', 72), ('Ëê¨', 72), ('‰∏â', 71), ('Ô§ò', 71), ('ÁÇ∫', 70), ('Ëá™', 67), ('Á©∫', 67), ('Ê≠§', 64), ('Èõ®', 63), ('Ô§ä', 62), ('4', 62), ('5', 62), ('6', 62), ('7', 62), ('8', 62), ('9', 62), ('Âéª', 62), ('‰ªä', 61), ('Âçó', 59), ('Âüé', 59), ('Ê¨≤', 59), ('ÂÆ∂', 58), ('Â∞á', 58), ('È¶¨', 58), ('Âè§', 58), ('Ô¶é', 58), ('Êú™', 57), ('ÈñÄ', 57), ('Ë•ø', 57), ('Âú®', 56), ('ÂøÉ', 56), ('Ê∏Ö', 56), ('È£õ', 56), ('ÂØí', 56), ('Â≠ê', 56), ('ËÅ≤', 56), ('ÂÆ¢', 55), ('‰∫ã', 54), ('Ëôï', 54), ('Âà•', 54), ('Êúù', 54), ('ÈôΩ', 53), ('ÈªÉ', 52), ('È´ò', 51), ('Â§ß', 51), ('ÂÖ•', 50), ('Ëàá', 50), ('Áéâ', 50), ('Âá∫', 50), ('ÈÅì', 50), ('Êúõ', 49), ('ÂçÅ', 49), ('Ôßä', 49), ('‰∫å', 48), ('Ê≠å', 48), ('ÈÄÅ', 48), ('ÂÆÆ', 48), ('Âæó', 47)]\n\nJust the characters\n\nÔºå. „ÄÇ.

We first found this theme prevalent in poetry from the Six Dynasties Period, and it isn't surprising that it continues to show in this dynasty. This also matches the writing we analyzed in class, like the nature descriptions Du Fu uses in poems like *A Song on How My Thatched Roof Was Ruined by the Autumn Wind*. It's also interesting that the word Mountain is the third highest word in the frequency list, and I'm still unsure why.\n\nAnother prominent theme is the passage of time, seen through words like Month, Year, Ancient, Today, Sun, Night, Autumn, Long, Time. We didn't see this theme appear in the poetry we read in class. Another thing that surprises me is that there are no words related to alcohol or drinking, because it was a common theme in Li Bai's work. The Dao is also mentioned more often than I expected, showing up 50 times. We discussed Daoism in class, and it was interesting to see it show up in these poems. I wondered if the Dao was being mentioned throughout the data or if there were one or two poets thatfocused on Daoism. I looked through the data for mentions of \"ÈÅì\" and they were relatively spread out. The poems are organized by author for the most part, meaning that the data must be from more than just a few of the poets.\n\nThere are also words like Travel, City, Gold, Jade, and Palace, which reflect the fact that many of the people who wrote poems were wealthy or came from rich households. Poetry was a very respected form of writing, and almost all poets were educated and literate with many of them serving in the government.\n\nOverall, the most frequent words typically matched what I expected, and gave further insight into the poetry of the Tang Dynasty. If I could continue this analysis, I would want to add more poems to my data set and dive further into the use of specific words like Dao. I could also improve the accuracy of this analysis with the help of a Chinese speaker and a deeper understanding of Chinese history.\n\n##### Sources\n_ÂîêËØó‰∏âÁôæÈ¶ñ by Hengtangtuishi_.

The first idea is continuing reflection 1, where I looked at the Will Wight's book series *Cradle*, its influences, and the meaning of its popularity. The series has heavy Daoist influences and throughout the readings for class I've found parallels to Cradle's story. The series is also based on the Chinese genre of xianxia, with the author in an interview saying he wanted to bring this genre of stories to a Western audience. This idea has been a success, and the series' last few installments have reached number one on Amazon's book list and number one in the New York Times bestselling audiobook list during their release. Cradle is categorized as progression fantasy, and I believe we will see stories like it become more popular in the future. While I've read other progression fantasy stories, I've read little xianxia, and for the final project would like to read a couple of these books, compare them to both Cradle and the readings from class, and see if I can chart out the influence of Chinese literature through this chain of works. I want to clearly define xianxia, wuxia, and cultivation,\n\nI want to understand the differences between xianxia, wuxia, and cultivation, show their influences (especially how they were influenced by the works we've discussed in class), show their histories as genres, where they are today, and where I think they will go in the future: to broader, global audiences. \n\nThe project will be split into two parts. One part will be a deep dive into the history of Chinese fantasy, tracing back xianxia and wuxia's influences and histories. The second part will be reading some of these works and comparing them.\n\nThere is a line that can be drawn from *Cradle* all the way back to [[Records of the Grand Historian]] and with this project I'd like to trace what we've learned in class to works being written today.\n\nThis is relevant to the class because these works I consider literature.

I analyzed its Daoist influences and its parallels to Chinese works that we've discussed in class. There was a lot more I wanted to articulate in that reflection, primarily how the series serves as a Western take on Chinese fantasy and why that's important.\n\nI first discovered the Cradle series two years ago, and I was inspired to look for more works like it. In an interview I found, the author talked about how Cradle was an attempt to \"westernize\" xianxia stories. I ended up looking into xianxia, cultivation, litrpg, and wuxia stories after reading Cradle, and I believe Cradle served as an entry point into these fantasy genres for many other readers as well. The last book released was the fourth in a row to reach #1 in the Amazon Kindle Store, and the Kickstarter to reprint the first three books stands as the fourth-highest-funded fiction Kickstarter on the website. This success, its direct inspiration from Chinese fantasy, and the large online communities dedicated to recommending books like Cradle are why I believe many readers like myself are being introduced to Chinese fantasy through the series. For this project, I want to start by talking about present-day fantasy series like Cradle and why their Chinese fantasy influences make not only them more successful, but also the works they were inspired by through people looking further into the genre. \n\nWhile looking into Cradle for the first reflection, I learned more about xianxia, wuxia, and their histories as fantasy subgenres. Diving further into the history of these genres, I found mentions of a lot of the texts we discussed in class, like [[A Burial Mound for Flowers|The Water Margin]], [[Journey to the West]], and more. There is a line that can be drawn from *Cradle* all the way back to [[Records of the Grand Historian]] and with this project I'd like to trace the works we've discussed in class to fantasy works being written today.\n\nBesides researching the history of the genres, I will also select different texts to analyze in order to see how Chinese fantasy has changed with these genres. One book I would like to look at is Jin Yong's [[Legend of the Condor Heroes]]. This book was written in 1957 and has been highly influential since its publication. Besides serving as a look into the past, the work also tells us about the spread of the wuxia genre today. An English translation of the story was published across four volumes from 2018 to 2021, showing the influence of Jin Yong's writing and reinforcing that these stories have become popular very recently among Western audiences. The work is extremely long, and I'm sure I won't be able to read all of it, but just reading a portion would still be insightful.\n\nI would also like to look at some cultivation novels. Cultivation is a subgenre of xianxia and focuses on Daoist ideas of cultivation. This genre seems to have been popularized fue to the growth of online works and web novels published on websites like Royal Road. I have read bits and pieces of these works before, but would like to explore them on a deeper level. I believe E-novels may be the frontier for Chinese fantasy today in terms of their spread to Western audiences, and I'd like to find if these works share themes or influences with Cradle. I will likely find other works to add to the project as well as I continue my research.\n\nThe project would be composed of either a writeup accompanied by a timeline or a website accompanied by a timeline. I would like to use Obsidian and its extension Quartz https://quartz.jzhao.xyz to create a website with pages linked together that takes the reader through the same content as a writeup would, but with more interactivity and organization. I want to use this project as an opportunity to try out this format and see what I can do with it. Using these tools, I should be able to make a timeline like the one shown below, with each entry pointing to the related page on the site, as an alternate way to interface with the project.\n\n![[Pasted image 20221120235736.png]]\n*Example timeline*\n\nThe final product would be a website detailing the history and evolution of Chinese fantasy, analysis of specific fantasy works, and the increased interest in Chinese fantasy works today. I will discuss the works we read in class through their role in the history of the genre and their connections to the specific books I read for the project. I may also include a section on why these fantasy works should be considered literature and what makes fantasy an important genre to discuss. I will also organize the website with an interactive timeline view.\n\n\nok done real final draft is below\n\n![[CHIN309 Reflection 3.pdf]]","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T05:29:43.144269377Z","tags":null},"/private/School-Vault/Assignments/Fall-2022-Assignments/CHIN309-Reflection-3-Scratch":{"title":"","content":"tags: #assignment \ncreation date: [[2022-11-07 Monday]] 20:06:44\ndescription::\n\ntopic\n-  final project proposal\n\t- ideas for final project\n\t\t- 1. continue first reflection topic\n\t\t\t- exploring connections to xianxia and wuxia\n\t\t\t- xianxia and wuxia as literature\n\t\t\t- xianxia and wuxia growing influence in western fantasy\n\t\t- 2. continue second reflection topic\n\t\t\t- distant reading analysis of chinese literature\n\t\t\t- can compare dynasties or something\n\t\t\t- idk really what to do with this\n\ndescription\n\u003e [!Assignment]\n\u003e Please submit a reflection based on material we have covered through October 25th!

The book is made up of the letters Bird sent to her sister throughout her trip. Bird enters the country in Yokohama, one of the first ports Japan opened to global trade, and from there travels to Tokyo. She prepares for her trip with the help of her European acquaintances living in Tokyo, and travels on foot, horseback, and boat throughout the country, ending in Hokkaido.\n\nWhile Bird's book serves to document her travels, it can be looked at today through the lens of Japan's rapid development during the Meiji era caused by pressure from Western forces. Mary Louise Pratt in the book *Imperial Eyes* examines similar Western forces of imperialism in the Americas and Africa. We can apply the concepts Pratt uses in *Imperial Eyes* to Bird's journey in *Unbeaten Tracks* to analyze how her travels contributed to Western imperialist efforts in Japan.\n\nBird's journey through Japan's interior was not only the first time many indigenous Japanese people encountered European culture, but also the first time many Europeans read about Japanese culture. In this way, Bird serves as a \"traveling contact zone.\"\n\nAs Pratt describes it, a contact zone is an area where cultures encounter, especially in an imperialist setting, where one culture has power over a smaller, indigenous culture. In Bird's case, the contact is between European and Japanese cultures. When Pratt refers to contact zones, it's typically about a location where groups from the two cultures meet, but here it is one woman moving from village to village, hence traveling contact zone. For many of the people she meets, this is one of the first times they've met a European and been exposed to their culture. This also goes the other way, as Bird's writings circulated in Europe, serving as many readers' first interaction with Japanese cultures. Bird's writings even circulated among cities in Japan, as travel was difficult, and many Japanese people living in urban areas never had the chance to interact with those living in rural areas.\n\nBird is also able to give a firsthand account of contact zones closer to Pratt's definition. Yokohama and Tokyo both serve as contact zones between Western and Japanese cultures, as they were areas integral to international trade. On her train ride from Yokohama to Edo, Bird describes how the rail was built by American engineers and how the Japanese officials riding with her wore European dress (Bird, 13-14). Another contact zone is between the Aino people and the Japanese government. Bird visits the Ainos, the indigenous people of Hokkaido, and describes how they have recently been struggling with the Japanese government's prohibitions on tattoos and arrow traps (Bird, 159, 165).\n\nIn her letters, Bird writes about the hardships she faced, mostly complaining about the quality of living in the villages she stays the night in. As the journey goes on, the reader gets an understanding of Bird's feelings towards Japan. She looks down on the people she meets and finds their living inferior, but revels in the opportunity to study them like a newly discovered species. In one encounter, as a crowd gathers around to see the foreigner that rode into town, she remarks, \n\n\"When I went out I found fully 1000 people helping me realize how the crowded cities of Judea sent forth people clothed much as these are when the Miracle-Worker from Galilee arrived, but not what the fatigue of the crowding and buzzing must have been to One who had been preaching and working during the long day\" (Bird, 66).\n\nWhile she goes back and forth throughout the text between indifference and derision, this quote where Bird likens herself to Jesus Christ shows the height of her ego. She portrays herself as an innocent traveler in a strange land but still sees herself as the most distinguished individual in the village. Bird here fits Pratt's idea of a \"protagonist of the anti-conquest\" (Pratt, 7).\n\nThe anti-conquest is an idea, or even a state of mind, where the colonizing party seeks to claim their actions innocent while continuing to assert their power. Bird is only traveling through Japan, not actively colonizing it, but she still is a part of the Western force pressuring Japan. She claims to just be a tourist, but actively airs her grievances with the current state of the country and looks down upon its people.\n\nThe third, final concept Pratt describes is autoethnography, or autoethnographic expression. Pratt describes autoethnographic expression as instances where the colonized take on the colonizer's culture, especially in an attempt to fight or otherwise engage the colonizer on the colonizer's terms. This is the most explicitly political of the three concepts, and as such, Bird's letters don't offer many instances because she avoids politics for most of the text. The Japanese officials' adoption of Western clothing may have been done to be taken more seriously by Western officials (Bird, 14). We also see during Bird's search for an interpreter that many Japanese people were learning English to find work opportunities (Bird, 17). While these people were not necessarily learning English to fight against Western forces, this does show the growing need for interpreters in Japan.\n\n Bird's travels, whether she knew it at the time or not, would pave the way for other foreign travelers in Japan, contributing to the country's rapid globalization. By analyzing her journey using Pratt's concepts of imperialism, it is clear that Bird contributed to the Western forces that pressured Japan into opening international trade and accepting Western cultures. Bird was one of the first foreigners to make the journey through the interior, and her writings brought many more travelers to Japan after her.","lastmodified":"2022-12-07T05:29:43.144269377Z","tags":null},"/private/School-Vault/Assignments/Fall-2022-Assignments/JAPN208-Essay-1-planning":{"title":"","content":"tags: #assignment \ncreation date: [[2022-09-23 Friday]] 21:39:49\nmodification date: [[2022-09-23 Friday]] 21:39:49\n\n## Essay 1 planning\n##### prompt\nWrite an 800 word paper on Isabella Bird‚Äôs¬†Unbeaten Tracks in Japan¬†in relation to the analytical concepts that Pratt introduces in her¬†Imperial Eyes, such as ‚Äúcontact zone.‚Äù First, explain these concepts, and then, discuss how these concepts can be applied to the analysis of Bird‚Äôs observations of Japan.
