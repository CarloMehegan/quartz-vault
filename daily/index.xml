Sunday, Feb 6 Hello bestie Obsidian updates since yesterday let&amp;rsquo;s see I didn&amp;rsquo;t do any more note taking and I didn&amp;rsquo;t walk around downtown because it was super cold but also last night i watched more videos about Obsidian and zettelkasten did you know that zettelkasten means wooden box of cards or something also in the video they talked about daily notes in obsidian and there&amp;rsquo;s an option to have a note created every day with the date and that sounds like a good way to have these thoughts and the daily notes I&amp;rsquo;m taking for school in Notion in one place.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://carlomehegan.github.io/quartz-vault/Daily/2022-02-07-Monday/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://carlomehegan.github.io/quartz-vault/Daily/2022-02-07-Monday/</guid><description>Tags: #daily #flashcards
